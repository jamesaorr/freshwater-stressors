"1","WOS:000375166800036","Behavioral swimming effects and acetylcholinesterase activity changes in Jenynsia multidentata exposed to chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin individually and in mixtures","The pesticides cypermethrin (CYP) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) were found together in water bodies located in agricultural and urban areas. However, the impact to non-target biota from exposure to mixtures has received little attention. In the current study, we evaluated changes in swimming behavior and cholinesterase enzymes activity in Jenynsia multidentata, to investigate the possible effects of these insecticides individually and in mixtures. Moreover, differences between technical and commercial mixtures of the pesticides were evaluated. Females off, multidentata were exposed over 96-h to CYP (0.04 and 0.4 mu g L-1), CPF (0.4 and 4 mu g L-1), individually and in a technical and commercial mixtures. Swimming behavior was recorded after 24 h and 96 h of exposure. Also, we measured cholinesterase enzymes activity in brain and muscle after 96 h of exposure. Exposure to CYP increased the exploratory activity of J. multidentata in the upper area of the aquarium. Fish exposed to CPF (4 mu g L-1) showed a decrease in swimming activity and an increase in the time spent at the bottom of the aquarium. Interestingly, fish exposed to the technical and commercial mixture of CYP and CPF displayed a different behavior based on the concentration of exposure. Low concentration of pesticides elicited an increase in J. multidentata swimming activity with preference for the upper area of the aquarium, and high concentrations caused decrease in swimming activity with preference for the bottom area of the aquarium. Based on the response of cholinesterase enzymes, acetylcholinesterase in muscle was more sensitive to exposure to CYP, CPF and their mixtures than in brain. A decrease in swimming behavior correlates significantly with the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle of J. multidentata exposed to high concentrations of pesticides. These results draw attention to the need of more studies on the potential ecotoxicological impact of pesticides and its mixtures at environmental relevant concentrations. (c) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

"2","WOS:000077057300022","Effects of ultraviolet light and methoprene on survival and development of Rana pipiens","Recently a suite of relatively specific hindlimb deformities have been observed in several anuran species in North America. These deformities include ectopic and supernumerary limbs and missing limbs, limb segments, or digits. The objective of this study was to assess two stressors hypothesized as responsible for limb malformations in amphibians: methoprene, an insect growth regulator that, through interaction with the retinoic acid signaling system, could possibly cause limb deformities, and ultraviolet (UV) light. Northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) were exposed to several different concentrations of methoprene both in the absence and presence of UV light designed to mimic the UV wavelength spectrum present in sunlight. Exposures were initiated at early embryonic stages (newly fertilized eggs) and continued through emergence of the forelimbs of the frogs. At the highest methoprene concentration tested, both in the absence and presence of UV light, severe developmental effects were observed, with all organisms dying within 12 to 16 d of test initiation. However, exposure to the pesticide did not cause limb malformations. Irrespective of methoprene treatment, a very high percentage (similar to 50%) of animals held under the UV light for 24 d developed hindlimb malformations. These malformations usually were bilateral and sometimes completely symmetrical, and consisted of missing limb segments and missing or reduced digits. A complete proximal to distal representation of the deficiencies occurred, ranging from missing or malformed femurs to the absence of single digits or digit segments. The developmental period of greatest sensitivity to UV light occurred during very early limb bud development, corresponding with formation of the apical ectodermal ridge. The significance of these findings in terms of deformed frogs in the held is uncertain. Although the deformity types observed (i.e., missing limb segments and digits) were similar to those seen in some field specimens, the UV light treatment did not cause the full range of malformations observed in animals from the field (e.g., supernumerary limbs, nonbilateral deformities). Furthermore, although the artificial light spectrum utilized mimicked the relative UV spectrum present in sunlight, it did not match full sunlight intensity, and did not accurately mimic visible wavelengths. Finally, the relationship of the UV light dose used in the laboratory to that actually experienced by amphibians in the field is uncertain. Despite these questions, our findings suggest that UV light should be further considered as a plausible factor contributing to amphibian malformations in field settings.",1,1,"biased"
"3","WOS:000341826300012","Joint Toxicity of Chlorpyrifos and Endosulfan to Pacific Treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) Tadpoles","Recent ecotoxicology studies have focused on the potential interaction of pesticides and the effects these interactions may have on aquatic ecosystems. We examined the combined effects of two insecticides, endosulfan and chlorpyrifos, that have been previously examined individually on survival, growth, and development of Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla) tadpoles. Historically, both pesticides have been heavily used in the Central Valley of California, been identified in downwind montane areas, and are highly toxic to amphibian larvae. Tadpoles were exposed to chlorpyrifos and endosulfan individually and in combination from Gosner stage 25 through metamorphosis to evaluate the individual effects and the interaction between these insecticides. Chlorpyrifos alone did not affect survival or body size after 30 days, even at concentrations greater than the previously reported LC50. Survival and body size decreased with increasing endosulfan concentrations. The interactive effects of the insecticides depended on concentration and exposure duration. In combination, 137 A mu g/L chlorpyrifos inhibited the negative effects of endosulfan on growth and survival. The presence of both insecticides in combination facilitated the development of axial malformations. In the presence of endosulfan with either 266 or 394 A mu g/L chlorpyrifos, malformations occurred in 33 and 87 % of tadpoles, respectively. Our results indicate that organophosphorus and organochlorine pesticides with different modes of action can result in varying interactions depending on their concentrations and on the end points being assessed. Further examination of contaminant impacts on natural aquatic systems should continue to focus on the effects of multiple contaminants and their potential for unpredictable, nonadditive interactions.",1,1,"biased"
"4","WOS:000587290300171","Environmental disturbance history undermines population responses to cope with anthropogenic and environmental stressors","Since aquatic ecosystems receive runoff of most anthropogenic pollutants, risk assessment tools and protocols have been developed in order to protect them. However, most ecological risk assessments focus on the study of single species exposed to a single chemical, overlooking the environmental reality of multiple chemical exposures and stresses over generations. To advance in realistic predictions of population and community changes, the environmental disturbance history should be considered. The aim of this study was to evaluate how environmental disturbance history (continuous expected sublethal exposure to one chemical for several generations) determines populations' responses to another stressors. The experiments were performed with Daphnia magna as model organisms. To create a disturbance history, dimethoate was used as first stressor at two different concentrations: medium (0.089 mg.L-1) and high (0.89 mg.L-1). The population exposed to medium concentration (vulnerable population) showed no differences from the control population in the selected parameters (body size and reproductive success). Our interest in the vulnerable population was to determine whether, after a first stressor, the detected non-effect hides a population impairment, which might undermine populations' responses to future stressors. After 4 generations under dimethoate exposure, the vulnerable D. magna population was exposed to a second chemical stressor (glyphosate) and an environmental stressor (food scarcity) as compared to control. The vulnerable population showed both less resistance to glyphosate and less resistance to starvation, corroborating the hypothesis that a disturbance history of continuous expected sublethal chemical exposures undermines populations' responses to further chemical and environmental stressors.

"5","WOS:000379931900007","Evolution determines how global warming and pesticide exposure will shape predator-prey interactions with vector mosquitoes","How evolution may mitigate the effects of global warming and pesticide exposure on predator-prey interactions is directly relevant for vector control. Using a space-for-time substitution approach, we addressed how 4 degrees C warming and exposure to the pesticide endosulfan shape the predation on Culex pipiens mosquitoes by damselfly predators from replicated low-and high-latitude populations. Although warming was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates on these prey. Possibly, under warming escape speeds of the mosquitoes increased more than the attack efficiency of the predators. Endosulfan imposed mortality and induced behavioral changes (including increased filtering and thrashing and a positional shift away from the bottom) in mosquito larvae. Although the pesticide was only lethal for the mosquitoes, it reduced predation rates by the low-latitude predators. This can be explained by the combination of the evolution of a faster life history and associated higher vulnerabilities to the pesticide (in terms of growth rate and lowered foraging activity) in the low-latitude predators and pesticide-induced survival selection in the mosquitoes. Our results suggest that predation rates on mosquitoes at the high latitude will be reduced under warming unless predators evolve toward the current low-latitude phenotype or low-latitude predators move poleward.",1,1,"biased"
"6","WOS:000280068900017","Individual- and population-level toxicity of the insecticide, spirotetramat and the agricultural adjuvant, Destiny to the Cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia","The effects of the tetramic acid insecticide, spirotetramat and the agricultural adjuvant, Destiny, were evaluated on the Cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia dubia. These compounds were evaluated separately and as a mixture because they can be applied together for control of certain crop pests and therefore have the potential to enter surface water as a binary mixture. Acute mortality estimates (48 h) were developed followed by chronic exposure (8 days) studies where several population parameters were recorded. Acute LC50 and 95% CL for spirotetramat and Destiny were estimated to be 23.8 (14.5-35.4) and 26.71 (20.8-34.0) mg/l, respectively. Thus, spirotetramat and Destiny were equitoxic to C. dubia at LC50. For the chronic population study, C. dubia populations were exposed to a range of concentrations for spirotetramat and Destiny singly and as a mixture. Each chemical alone reduced the number of founding individuals, offspring/female, final population size, and population growth rate in a concentration-dependent manner. However, exposure to the mixture caused significantly greater reductions in these parameters than either compound alone. These results indicate that agricultural adjuvants and pesticides may cause more damage to aquatic organisms as a mixture than either product alone. Therefore, future evaluations of pesticide effects should consider the effects of adjuvants as a mixture with pesticides when these products are recommended to be applied together for pest control.",1,1,"biased"

As polluted ecosystems may simultaneously present other multiple natural stressors, the objective of the present study was to evaluate joint effect of stressors (natural and anthropogenic) on life history traits of the Neotropical cladoceran, Ceriodaphnia silvestrii. For this purpose, the effects of water conditioned with predator kairomones (fish) and environmental concentrations (sublethal) of two pesticides widely used in sugarcane monoculture in Brazil, the insecticide Regent(R)800 WG (active ingredient-a.i. fipronil) and the herbicide DMA(R)806 BR (a.i. 2,4-D) were evaluated using chronic toxicity testing, isolated and in mixture, for this cladoceran species. The environmental risks of pesticides for tropical freshwater biota were also estimated from the risk quotient MEC/PNEC. Among the characteristics of the life history of C. silvestrii evaluated after 8 days of exposure, compared with the mean value of control, the age of primiparous females was not affected by any evaluated treatment. However, species average survival decreased in the treatment of kairomones mixed with fipronil (FK) and in the treatment with a mixture of fipronil, 2,4-D, and kairomones (MFKD). The body length of maternal females was shorter than in the control after exposure in treatments with only kairomones (K) and FK. Fecundity of this cladoceran was reduced when exposed to FK and MFKD treatments, and the intrinsic rate of population increase significantly decreased for organisms exposed to treatment with fipronil (F) and to mixtures of fipronil and 2,4-D (MFD), MFDK, and FK. The results indicated that the combination of anthropogenic and natural stressors causes changes inC. silvestriilife history traits, which can contribute to the decline in populations, and our preliminary risk assessment results are a matter of concern regarding biota conservation.",1,1,"biased"
"8","WOS:000462259300014","The effects of bifenthrin and temperature on the endocrinology of juvenile Chinook salmon","The San Francisco Bay delta (USA) is experiencing seasonally warmer waters attributable to climate change and receives rainstorm runoff containing pyrethroid pesticides. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) inhabit the affected waterways from hatch through smoltification, and thus juvenile fish may experience both pyrethroid and warmer water exposures. The effects of higher temperatures and pesticide exposure on presmolt Chinook are unknown. To improve understanding of the potential interaction between temperature and pesticide exposure on salmonid development, juvenile alevin and fry were reared in 11, 16.4, and 19 degrees C freshwater for 11 d and 2 wk, respectively, and exposed to nominal concentrations of 0, 0.15, and 1.5 mu g/L bifenthrin for the final 96 h of rearing. Estradiol-17 beta (E2), testosterone, triiodothyronine, and thyroxine levels were measured in whole-body homogenates using hormone-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Brain gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH2), dopamine receptor 2A, and growth hormone 1 (GH1) mRNA levels were measured using quantitative PCR. Results showed significantly decreased survival and condition factors observed with increasing temperature in alevin. Alevin thyroid hormones increased significantly with temperature, but fry thyroid hormones trended toward a decrease at lower temperatures with increasing bifenthrin exposure. There were significant reductions in fry testosterone and E2 at 11 degrees C with increasing bifenthrin treatments and significant changes in GnRH2 and GH1 gene expression in both alevin and fry, indicating potential disruption of hormonal and signaling pathways.

"9","WOS:000408783600009","Single and mixture impacts of two pyrethroids on damselfly predatory behavior and physiological biomarkers","Direct mortality due to toxicity of single pesticide exposure along a concentration gradient, while the most common, is only one important parameter for assessing the effects of pesticide contamination on aquatic ecosystems. Sub-lethal toxicity can induce changes in an organism's behavior and physiology that may have population -level ramifications and consequences for ecosystem health. Additionally, the simultaneous detection of multiple contaminants in monitored watersheds stresses the importance of gaining a greater understanding of the toxicities of combined exposures, particularly at low, environmentally relevant concentrations. Using larvae of the Azure Damselfly (Coenagrion paella), we conducted a combined exposure investigation of two widely-used pyrethroid insecticides presumed to share the same neurotoxic mechanism of action, and estimated their effect on predatory ability, mobility and three physiological biomarkers (Glutathione S-transferase; GST, respiratory electron transport system; ETS, and malondialdehyde; MDA). Deltamethrin exposure (0.065 mu g/L and 0.13 mu g/L) was found to reduce the predatory ability, but it did not affect the larvae's mobility. Esfenvalerate exposure (0.069 mu g/L and 0.13 mu g/L), on the other hand, induced no significant changes in predatory ability or mobility. The decrease in predatory ability after the combination exposure (0.067 mu g/L deltamethrin and 0.12 mu g/L. esfenvalerate) did not significantly differ from the impact of the single deltamethrin exposures. Glutathione-S-transferase was induced after single esfenvalerate exposure and the lower deltamethrin concentration exposure, but seemingly inhibited after exposure to the higher concentration of deltamethrin as well as the combination of both pyrethroids. Our data indicate that sub-lethal exposure to deltamethrin reduces predatory ability and suggest that sub-lethal combined exposure to deltamethrin and esfenvalerate inhibits the GST detoxification pathway. These effects can eventually result in a lower emergence of adults from contaminated ponds.",1,1,"biased"

The present study examined combined effects of water temperature, chemical concentration, and duration of exposure to the neonicotinoid thiacloprid on marbled crayfish Procambarus virginalis. Crayfish were exposed to thiacloprid at the environmental concentration of 4.50 mu g L-1 and 10% 96LC50 to marbled crayfish, 64.64 mu g L-1, at water temperature of 17 and 23 degrees C for 28 days followed by a 28 day depuration period. No crayfish died during the experiment. Both thiacloprid concentrations at 23 degrees C showed a synergistic effect with temperature on the biochemical indicators in haemolymph compared to those at 17 degrees C. Both concentrations of thiacloprid at both temperatures were associated with significant differences from thiacloprid-free controls (P < 0.01) in haemolymph glucose, ammonia, calcium, inorganic phosphate, and lactate; haemolymph enzymes aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and alkaline phosphatase; antioxidant biomarkers superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione S-transferase, and reduced glutathione in hepatopancreas, muscle, and gill, and showed lipid peroxidation in hepatopancreas and muscle.

The aim of this study was to determine the single and joint effect of two widely used pesticides in southern South America on a widely distributed fish species. In a 96-h assay, individuals of Cnesterodon decemmaculatus were exposed to 0.84 nL/L and 8.4 nL/L of Clorfox and 0.2 mg/L and 2 mg/L of Roundup Max, commercial formulations of chlorpyrifos and glyphosate, respectively. Also, there were four mixture treatments with all the possible combinations of both pesticides. A multi-level approach was carried out to assess their effects covering the following relevant biomarkers: behavior (immobile time, line crossings and average speed), somatic conditions (Fulton condition factor and hepatosomatic index), serum parameters (cortisol levels, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase activity (CPK)), brain and muscle acetylcholinesterase and cytological characteristics (micronuclei frequency and nuclear abnormalities in erythrocytes). Our results showed that Clorfox exposures affect behavioral parameters, serum cortisol, and nuclear characteristics of erythrocytes. Roundup Max affects only the cortisol levels whereas mixture treatments have an effect on behavioral parameters, cortisol levels, LDH and CPK activities, and nuclear characteristics of erythrocytes. Potentiation was the main interaction at the lowest concentrations of both pesticides whereas antagonism occurred at the highest concentrations of both pesticides. These results are highly significant since they arise from an integrated ecotoxicological assessment at several levels of biological organization but even more important is that the potentiated effects of the mixtures we registered are environmentally relevant concentrations.

"12","WOS:000304569700012","Oxidative stress response and histopathological changes due to atrazine and chlorpyrifos exposure in common carp","Atrazine (ATR) and chlorpyrifos (CPF) are the most common pesticides found in freshwater ecosystems throughout the world. Herein, we investigated the oxidative stress responses and histopathological changes in the liver and gill of common carp after a 40-d exposure to CPF and AIR, alone or in combination, and a 20-d recovery treatment. We found that exposure to ATR, CPF or their mixture for 40 d could induce decrease in antioxidant enzyme (SOD, CAT and GSH-Px) activities and increase in MDA content in a dose-dependent manner in the liver and gill of common carp. Especially with regard to the pathological changes, the tissue damage increased in severity in a dose-dependent manner. The liver tissue of common carp revealed different degree of hydropic degeneration, vacuolisation, Pyknotic nuclei, and fatty infiltration. The gills of common carp displayed varied degrees of epithelial hypertrophy, telangiectasis, oedema with epithelial separation from basement membranes, general necrosis, and epithelial desquamation. After a 20-d recovery treatment, the antioxidant enzyme activities and MDA content were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in the corresponding exposure groups in all of the highest doses, but not in the lower doses. To our knowledge, this is the first report of subchronic oxidative stress and histopathological effects caused by ATR, CPF and their mixture in the common carp. Thus, the information presented in this study is helpful to understand the mechanism of ATR-, CPF- and ATR/CPF-mixture-induced oxidative stress in fish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

"13","WOS:000424130500007","Strong differences between two congeneric species in sensitivity to pesticides in a warming world","To predict the impact of pesticides in a warming world we need to know how species differ in the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. Trait-based approaches have been successful in identifying the 'pace of life' and body size as predictors of sensitivity to pesticides among distantly related species. However, it remains to be tested whether these traits allow predicting differences in sensitivity to pesticides between closely related species, and in the strength of the interaction pathways between pesticides and warming. We tested the effects of multiple pulses of chlorpyrifos (allowing accumulation) under warming on key life history traits, heat tolerance (CTmax) and physiology of two congeneric damselfly species: the fast-paced (fast growth and development, high metabolic rate), small Ischnura pumilio and the slow-paced, large I. elegans. Chlorpyrifos reduced survival and growth, but contrary to current trait-based predictions I. pumilio was 8 x less sensitive than I. elegans. The lower sensitivity of I. pumilio could be explained by a higher fat content, and higher activities of acetylcholinesterase and of detoxifying and anti-oxidant enzymes. While for I. pumilio the effect of chlorpyrifos was small and did not depend on temperature, for I. elegans the impact was higher at 20 degrees C compared to 24 degrees C. This matches the higher pesticide accumulation in the water after multiple pulses at 20 degrees C than at 24 degrees C. The expected reduction in heat tolerance after pesticide exposure was present in I. elegans but not in I. pumilio. Our results demonstrate that closely related species can have very different sensitivities to a pesticide resulting in species-specific support for the toxicant-induced climate change sensitivity and the climate-induced toxicant sensitivity interaction pathways. Our results highlight that trait-based approaches can be strengthened by integrating physiological traits. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",1,1,"biased"
"14","WOS:000519994800130","The effect of warming on pesticide toxicity is reversed between developmental stages in the mosquito Culex pipiens","A better understanding of interactions between pesticides and warming is important to improve ecological risk assessment in a warming world. Current insights are almost exclusively based on studies that exposed animals simultaneously to both warming and a pesticide and focused on effects during the pesticide exposure period and within a single developmental stage. We studied two ignored aspects of the interplay between warming and pesticide exposure: (i) the role of delayed effects after the pesticide exposure period, and (ii) the dependence on the developmental stage. We carried out a longitudinal experiment from the egg stage to the adult stage in the mosquito Culex pipiens where we crossed a warming treatment (20 degrees C vs 24 degrees C) with 48 h exposures to the pesticide chlorpyrifos in three developmental stages (early L1 larvae, late L4 larvae and adults). Chlorpyrifos induced mild to moderate mortality in all developmental stages (10-30%). A key finding was that warming shaped the chlorpyrifos-induced mortality but in opposite directions between stages. Chlorpyrifos was 7% less toxic under warming in L1 larvae, yet more toxic under warming in L4 larvae (22%) and in adult males (33%), while toxicity did not change under warming in adult females. We hypothesize that the general, stage-specific differences in the effects of warming on body size (increased size in early larvae, decreased size in later stages) caused the reversal of the effects of warming on toxicity between stages. Previous larval exposure to chlorpyrifos caused delayed effects that strongly reduced survival to the adult stage (25% at 24 degrees C). Notably, warming also modulated these delayed mortality effects in opposite ways between developmental stages, matching the patterns of mortality during the pesticide exposure periods. Integrating the general stage-specific patterns of how warming shapes body size is important to advance our mechanistic understanding of the interactions between pesticides and warming.

The results revealed that the glycogen content was found to be decreasing. In contrast increase in the tissues lactate and pyruvate level was found in the fishes exposed to pesticide and fertilizer individually and in combinations. The combined effects of these chemicals were more toxic to carbohydrate metabolism than the effect produced by the individual chemicals. The results were tested to search for statistical significance. The calculated lactate and pyruvate ratio (UP) indicated that the fishes were under chemical stress. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of the chemicals on an exponentially-growing population of the two species were evaluated using single compounds and a compound mixture. The experiments lasted for 27 days. The results show a decrease in the populations' growth for both species after the application of single pesticides and the mixture. 2,4-D applied alone and the mixture of both chemicals have affected the organisms the most. Both pesticides have induced an increase in chlorophyll-a content in M. griffithii while no effect was observed on chlorophyll-a in Coscinodiscus sp. A significant effect was recorded in the cell size of both species with both pesticides. The two spirotetramat tested concentrations have induced an increase in cell size, while the opposite effect was obtained for the (2,4-D) herbicide concentrations. The mixture of compounds induced an additive effect on the cell size of both species. These results indicate the risk which the two chemicals represent in a natural environment.

Among IGRs, pyriproxyfen (PXF) is widely used and has been shown to prevent larvae from developing into adults, rendering them unable to reproduce. However, because of the similarity of crustacean and insect endocrine systems, PXF could also impact aquatic crustaceans. In addition, when spreading in the environment, PXF is found in a mixture with other pollutants such as metallic trace elements, which could alter its effect. Consequently, the present work was devoted to analysing the effects of PXF on the methylfarnesoate (MF) hormonal pathway of the freshwater amphipod Gammarus pulex, as well as its combined binary effects with cadmium (Cd), by measuring MF concentration, as well as the relative transcriptional expression of the farnesoic acid O-methyltransferase (FAMeT) (enzyme limiting the MF production), the methoprene-tolerant receptor (Met), and the broad-complex (BrC) as a transcription factor. Results revealed that single exposures to PXF or Cd have mainly overexpressed FAMeT, Met, and BrC but did not significantly affect MF concentration. Conversely, the mixture exposures seemed to suppress these effects and even achieve antagonistic effects. This work confirmed that PXF single exposure could impact non-target organisms such as amphipods through changes in hormonal pathways of MF. In the same way, it highlighted that Cd could also impair the endocrine system of exposed organisms. However, antagonistic effects have been observed in exposure to mixtures, suggesting different long-term consequences on the growth of amphipods under realistic exposure conditions.",1,1,"biased"

Chlorpyrifos and difenoconazole have been identified as agrochemicals widely used in banana and pineapple crops in the Caribbean area of the country and are constantly recorded in aquatic ecosystems. The toxicity of these pesticides in Parachromis dovii was studied. Median lethal concentrations (LC50s) for each substance were obtained from 96-h acute tests. Then, fish were exposed to sublethal concentrations of both substances (10% of LC50), individually and in mixture, to evaluate biomarker responses. Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), catalase, and glutathione S-transferase activities as well as lipid peroxidation were measured in liver and gill tissues as markers of biotransformation and oxidative stress processes. Cholinesterase activity in brain and muscle tissue was also quantified as a biomarker of toxicity. The LC50s were 55.34 mu g/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 51.06-59.98) for chlorpyrifos and 3250 mu g/L (95% CI 2770-3810) for difenoconazole. Regarding the biomarkers, a significant inhibition of brain and muscle cholinesterase activity was recorded in fish exposed to 5.50 mu g/L of chlorpyrifos. This activity was not affected when fish were exposed to the mixture of chlorpyrifos with difenoconazole. Significant changes in lactate dehydrogenase activity were observed in fish exposed to 325 mu g/L of difenoconazole, whereas fish exposed to the mixture showed a significant increase in EROD activity in the liver. These results suggest harmful effects of chlorpyrifos insecticide at environmentally relevant concentrations.

"19","WOS:000368888100023","Cadmium potentiates toxicity of cypermethrin in zebrafish","Co-occurrence of pesticides such as synthetic pyrethroids and metals in aquatic ecosystems raises concerns over their combined ecological effects. Cypermethrin, 1 of the top 5 synthetic pyrethroids in use, has been extensively detected in surface water. Cadmium (Cd) has been recognized as 1 of the most toxic metals and is a common contaminant in the aquatic system. However, little information is available regarding their joint toxicity. In the present study, combined toxicity of cypermethrin and Cd and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Zebrafish embryos and adults were exposed to the individual contaminant or binary mixtures. Co-exposure to cypermethrin and Cd produced synergistic effects on the occurrence of crooked body, pericardial edema, and noninflation of swim bladder. The addition of Cd significantly potentiated cypermethrin-induced spasms and caused more oxidative stress in zebrafish larvae. Cypermethrin-mediated induction of transcription levels and catalytic activities of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme were significantly down-regulated by Cd in both zebrafish larvae and adults. Chemical analytical data showed that in vitro elimination of cypermethrin by CYP1A1 was inhibited by Cd. The addition of Cd caused an elevation of in vivo cypermethrin residue levels in the mixture-exposed adult zebrafish. These results suggest that the enhanced toxicity of cypermethrin in the presence of Cd results from the inhibitory effects of Cd on CYP-mediated biotransformation of this pesticide.

There is also a growing need to determine if other environmental stressors, especially those predicted to worsen with climate change, interact with pesticides to alter their effects on non-target biota. Two such stressors are increased extreme temperature events and periods of food limitation. This study is the first to investigate the combined effects of the world's most widely used insecticide, imidacloprid, with heatwaves and food limitation on a freshwater animal. A 6-week, full-factorial laboratory experiment with Deleatidium spp. mayfly nymphs was performed to investigate the potential for direct and delayed interactive effects of simulated heatwaves and starvation with chronic exposure to a field-realistic concentration of imidacloprid (0.4 mu g/L). The experiment included two 6-day simulated heatwaves, one during a starvation period prior to imidacloprid addition, and one during the first 6 days of imidacloprid exposure. The simulated heatwaves alone caused such drastic negative effects on Deleatidium survival and mobility that mainly antagonistic interactions were observed with the other stressors, though delayed synergisms between imidacloprid and the second heatwave also affected mayfly mobility. Time-cumulative toxicity of imidacloprid was evident, with imidacloprid first affecting mayfly mobility after 12 days but eventually causing the strongest effects of all manipulated stressors. However, lethal effects of imidacloprid could only be detected in the absence of heatwaves and starvation, possibly as a result of selection for stronger individuals due to prior exposure to these stressors. Our findings demonstrate that heatwaves of increasing severity will critically affect sensitive freshwater organisms such as mayflies, and that the impacts of widespread pesticide use on freshwater ecosystems under global climate change cannot be ignored.

"21","WOS:000721255600014","Multiple Stress Reduces the Advantage of Pesticide Adaptation","Under global change scenarios, multistress conditions may occur regularly and require adaptation. However, the adaptation to one stressor might be associated with the increased sensitivity to another stressor. Here, we investigated the ecological consequences of such trade-off under multiple stress. We compared the pesticide tolerance of the crustacean Gammarus pulex from agricultural streams with populations from reference streams. Under optimum temperature, G. pulex from agricultural streams were considerably more tolerant to pesticides as compared to the reference populations. Here, we assume that the increased tolerance in agricultural populations is the combination of acclimation, epigenetic effect, and genetic evolution. After experimental pre-exposure to very low concentration (LC50/1000), reference populations showed increased pesticide tolerance. In contrast, pre-exposure did not further increase the tolerance of agricultural populations. Moreover, these populations were more sensitive to elevated temperature alone due to the hypothesized fitness cost of genetic adaptation to pesticides. However, both reference and agricultural populations showed a similar tolerance to the combined stress of pesticides and warming due to stronger synergistic effects in adapted populations. As a result, pesticide adaptation loses its advantage. The combined effect was predicted well using the stress addition model, developed for predicting the synergistic interaction of independent stressors. We conclude that under multistress conditions, adaptation to pesticides reduces the general stress capacity of individuals and trade-off processes increase the sensitivity to additional stressors. This causes strong synergistic effects of additional stressors on pesticide-adapted individuals.",1,1,"biased"

To explore the multi-generational toxicity of cadmium (Cd) and tributyltin (TBT), adult zebrafish (Dank) rerio) (F0) were exposed to different treated groups (100 ng/l Cd, 100 ng/l TBT and their mixture) for 90 d, with their offspring (F1 and F2) subsequently reared in the same exposure solutions corresponding to their parents. Both developmental neurotoxicity and thyroid disturbances were examined in the three (F0, F1, and F2) generations. Our results showed that co-exposure to Cd and TBT induced the developmental neurotoxicity in F1 and F2 generations, reflected by the significant lower levels of neuro-transmitters (dopamine and serotonin) and the inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities. And the thyroid endocrine disruption were observed in the two-generations larval offspring by parental exposure to Cd and/or TBT, including the significantly decreasing levels of thyroid hormones and the down-regulated the expression of genes involved in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis, compared to the control. Additional, the embryonic toxicity and growth inhibition were also determined in the fish larvae. Overall, this study examined the impacts of parental co-exposure to Cd and TBT, with regard to developmental inhibition, nervous system damage and endocrine disruption, which highlighted that co-exposure influences are complicated and need to be considered for accurate environmental risk assessment.

The highest yield (79.68%) of MDF was obtained by enzymatic digestion with 0.1% -amylase (w/v), 0.1% amyloglucosidase (v/v) and 1% neutrase (v/v). MDF and fish tissue were subjected to in vitro digestion and results suggest that MDF may reduce mercury bioaccessibility from fish to 34% to 85% compared to control in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, accumulation of mercury from digesta containing fish and MDF was only modestly impacted by the presence of MDF.

An individual 45-minute session would consist of a warm-up period with gentle stretching, a cardiovascular segment, a cool-down period, strength-training, and a final stretching time. All exercises would be conducted with participants wearing the water walkers, allowing total immersion to the shoulder. Free to move about the pool, they would be encouraged to interact socially with one another.

When determining how species traits influence vulnerability to fragmentation, however, several important confounding factors such as detectability and synergistic effects among traits are rarely considered. In this study, after controlling for these methodological shortcomings, we determined how species traits influenced fragmentation vulnerability using bird data collected from islands created by the inundation of the Thousand Island Lake, China. We obtained eight species traits from field surveys and from the literature: natural abundance, geographical range size, habitat specificity, body size, trophic level, mobility, fecundity, and nest type. After phylogenetic correction, these traits were used separately and in combination to assess their associations with the index of fragmentation vulnerability, the proportion of islands occupied. Inclusion of detectability in analysis resulted in considerable increases in overall island occupancy for all species in general and for cryptic species in particular. Accounting for detectability altered the rank of best models and thus influenced the identification of the relationships between species traits and fragmentation vulnerability. We found synergistic interactions between natural abundance and habitat specificity. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating detectability and synergistic effects among traits into future studies. From a conservation perspective, our results suggest that we should give priority conservation efforts to rare species with low natural abundance and high habitat specificity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

These compounds were tested in vitro against Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 (reference and control strains), three methicillin-resistant isolates of S. aureus, and three isolates of vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis. 1-[3-(Dipropylammonio)-2-({[3-(pentyloxy-/hexyloxy-/heptyloxy)phenyl]carbamoyl}oxy)propyl]pyrrolidinium dichlorides showed high activity against staphylococci and enterococci comparable with or higher than that of used controls (clinically used antibiotics and antiseptics). The screening of the cytotoxicity of the compounds as well as the used controls was performed using human monocytic leukemia cells. IC50 values of the most effective compounds ranged from ca. 3.5 to 6.3 mu M, thus, it can be stated that the antimicrobial effect is closely connected with their cytotoxicity. The antibacterial activity is based on the surface activity of the compounds that are influenced by the length of their alkoxy side chain, the size of the azacyclic system, and hydro-lipophilic properties, as proven by in vitro experiments and chemometric principal component analyses. Synergistic studies showed the increased activity of oxacillin, gentamicin, and vancomycin, which could be explained by the direct activity of the compounds against the bacterial cell wall.

The objective of this paper is to evaluate the actual status of Web-enabled public services to citizens in municipal e-government implementation in the Yangtze River delta. Eight categories of public services to citizens delivered through the Internet have been identified in the Web sites of the 14 local municipal governments.

Using the methodology of service maturity, this study evaluates the quality and usage of public e-services to citizens in the Yangtze River delta. The results of this study show that almost all city governments are shifting from the traditional bureaucratic paradigm to the e-govemment public service paradigm albeit with significant differences in public e-services level in these cities. At present, e-government public services to citizens in almost all the cities studied are mostly limited to on-line presentations of government information with a low degree of development of interaction and on-line transaction.

A region on the edge of the high reflectance waters that characterised the bloom was labelled with SF6-tracer and tracked for 6 days. Within the framework of this Lagrangian experiment, it was possible to compile a comprehensive budget of the transformation of DMSP to DMS in the surface mixed layer of 15-30 m depth and a subsurface layer that extended to greater than or equal to40 m. As a basis to the synthesis of the DMS(P) biogeochemistry, an attempt was made to accurately constrain DMS emissions from the Lagrangian water mass. Included in the study is a comparison of estimates of the transfer velocity and DMS sea to air flux derived from two well established and two recently introduced parameterisations. The two recent approaches encouragingly gave similar rates of total DMS sea to air flux of 1.60 mg S m(-2) over the 6-day experimental period, and this value was intermediate to values derived from the two more routinely used approaches. The DMS sea to air flux was equivalent in terms of sulphur, to 10% of the DMS production and 1.3% of the particulate DMSP (DMSPp) production in the surface layer over the 6 days. Bacterial consumption accounted for the majority of DMS removal in both surface (62-82%) and subsurface layers (average 98%) and DMS concentrations decreased over the 6 days, despite increasing DMS production. Microzooplankton were the main agents of the transformation of DMSPp to the dissolved phase but little DMS appeared to be produced directly by the grazers. Instead, bacteria rapidly turned over the dissolved DMSP (DMSPd) made available by the grazers. An upper limit of 17% of the DMSPd consumed by bacteria in the surface layer was cleaved to DMS over the 6 days. Lower transformation efficiencies of similar to6% were estimated for the subsurface layer. An ecosystem model incorporating DMS(P) biogeochemistry was developed on the basis of the empirical data. Simple sensitivity analyses were employed to demonstrate the importance of both microzooplankton and bacterial metabolism in controlling the yield of DMS from DMSP production and hence, the DMS sea to air flux. Greater yields of DMS are likely to occur when DMSPp is transformed directly to DMS, in this case due to grazing, than when transformed to DMSPd and subsequently cleaved to DMS by bacterial activity. The point of DMS production in the DMSPp to DMS transformation pathway is likely to alter in relation to phytoplankton bloom progression and with season. The complex interaction amongst heterotrophic processes that control DMS concentrations suggests that attempts to predict global DMS flux may need to couple comprehensive ecosystem models of the type used in this study, to general circulation models.

Realgar is one of the most abundant arsenic sulphide minerals and usually treated as waste in industry. The aim of the present study was to screen an arsenic tolerant bacterium used for bioleaching arsenic from realgar. Results: An acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium BYQ-12 was isolated from Wudalianchi volcanic lake in northeast China. BYQ-12 was a motile, rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium with an optimum growth at 30 degrees C and pH 2.5. 16S rDNA phylogeny showed that BYQ-12 was a new strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The inhibitory concentrations (ICs) of arsenite and arsenate were 32 and 64 mM, respectively. A significant second-order model was established using a Box-Behnken design of response surface methodology (BBD-RSM) and it estimated that a maximum arsenic bioleaching rate (73.97%) could be obtained when the pulp concentration, pH and initial ferrous ion concentration were set at optimized values of 0.95% w/v, 1.74 and 3.68 g/L, respectively. SEM, EDS and XRD analyses also revealed that there was direct bioleaching besides indirect electrochemical leaching in the arsenic bioleaching system. Conclusion: Fromthis workwe were successful in isolating an acidophilic, arsenic tolerant ferrous iron-oxidizing bacterium. The BBD-RSM analysis showed that maximum arsenic bioleaching rate obtained under optimum conditions, and the most effective factor for arsenic leaching was initial ferrous ion concentration. These revealed that BYQ-12 could be used for bioleaching of arsenic from arsenical minerals. (C) 2016 Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Valparaiso. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Puerto Rico is a Caribbean tropical island that may serve as a model to illustrate the interactions between humans and natural resources in such complex ecosystems. The native freshwater fish assemblage of Puerto Rico is distinct from mainland assemblages in that the assemblage is not diverse, all species are diadromous, and they may be exploited at multiple life stages (e.g., postlarva, juvenile, adult). Primary large-scale drivers of recent water use policy include economic growth, human population density, and urbanization, with climate change as an overarching influence. Watershed and riparian land use, water quality, river flow and instream physical habitat, river habitat connectivity, exotic species, and aquatic resource exploitation are important proximate factors affecting the ecosystem and fisheries. Research on ecological processes and components of the stream and river fish assemblages has expanded the knowledge base in the past decade with the goal of providing critical information for guiding the conservation and management of the lotic resource to optimize ecosystem function and services.

The isotope method of determining water balance of groundwater-controlled lakes was examined in some detail using the field data collected during this study. The calculations performed for different sets of input data revealed that the approach recommended in the literature, i.e. the use of oxygen-18 data, the air-based temperatures and the mean isotopic composition of evaporation flux calculated from the annual mean isotopic composition of precipitation assuming isotope equilibrium at the ground-level temperature, may lead to groundwater inflow rates which are underestimated by as much as 40%, The isotope-mass balance calculations performed independently for deuterium and oxygen-18 data can be reconciled within the overall uncertainty of the method, when the surface water temperature of a lake (with relative humidity adjusted accordingly) is used instead of ground-level air temperature, and the isotopic composition of the evaporation flux is adequately averaged, taking into account the seasonal variability of this flux for the given lake system. The sensitivity analysis of the isotope-mass balance calculations performed for the studied lake system suggests that the critical parameter for the overall accuracy of the method is the isotopic composition of the lake water and, to a lesser extent, of the subsurface inflow, in cases where the isotope enrichment of lake water is relatively small. In the studied case this enrichment reached only about 20% of the isotopic composition of the input. In general, the use of isotope-mass balance for determining subsurface inflow and outflow rates to dredging lakes would require a rather extensive monitoring of isotope and hydrological parameters of the studied system, performed on a monthly basis for at least one full hydrological year. The isotope and geochemical data gathered in the present study were used to derive mixing proportions of lake water with the downgradient groundwater field. The plume of the lake water could be traced up to about 4 km from the lakes, along the general direction of groundwater flow. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",0,0,"diverse"

How the metabolic demands of such a massive growth rate impacts muscle performance that competes for ATP is unknown. Here, we integrate aspects of contractility, protein synthesis, and energy metabolism in mantle of specimens weighing 1.1 g to lend insight into the processes. Isolated mantle muscle preparations were electrically stimulated and isometric force development monitored. Preparations were forced to contract at 3 Hz for 30 s to simulate a jetting event. We then measured oxygen consumption, glucose uptake and protein synthesis in the hour following the stimulation. Protein synthesis was inhibited with cycloheximide and glycolysis was inhibited with iodoacetic acid in a subset of samples. Inhibition of protein synthesis impaired contractility and decreased oxygen consumption. An intact protein synthesis is required to maintain contractility possibly due to rapidly turning over proteins. At least, 41% of whole animal. <(M) over dot>O-2 is used to support protein synthesis in mantle, while the cost of protein synthesis (50 mu mol O-2 mg protein(-1)) in mantle was in the range reported for other aquatic ectotherms. A single jetting challenge stimulated protein synthesis by approximately 25% (2.51-3.12% day(-1)) over a 1 h post contractile period, a similar response to that which occurs in mammalian skeletal muscle. Aerobic metabolism was not supported by extracellular glucose leading to the contention that at this life stage either glycogen or amino acids are catabolized. Regardless, an intact glycolysis is required to support contractile performance and protein synthesis in resting muscle. It is proposed that glycolysis is needed to maintain intracellular ionic gradients. Intracellular glucose at approximately 3 mmol L-1 was higher than the 1 mmol L-1 glucose in the bathing medium suggesting an active glucose transport mechanism.

It is less clear, however, whether many natural stressors are immunosuppressive. Moreover, whether stressors make disease more likely or more severe in populations is unclear because animals respond to stressors both behaviorally and physiologically. We tested whether chronic exposure to three natural stressors of wood frog tadpoles-high-densities, predator-cues, and low-food conditions-influence their susceptibility to a lethal ranavirus both individually in laboratory experiments, and collectively in outdoor mesocosms. Prior to virus exposure, we observed elevated corticosterone only in low-food treatments, although other treatments altered rates of growth and development as well as tadpole behavior. None of the treatments, however, increased susceptibility to ranavirus as measured by the proportion of tadpoles that became infected or died, or the time to death compared to controls. In fact, mortality in the mesocosms was actually lower in the high-density treatment even though most individuals became infected, largely because of increased rates of metamorphosis. Overall we find no support for the hypothesis that chronic exposure to common, ecologically relevant challenges necessarily elevates corticosterone levels in a population or leads to more severe ranaviral disease or epidemics.

As future climate change projections imply an increased risk of extreme events, the occurrence of droughts is potentially accelerating in the future. The influence of climate change on drought events in a Danish agricultural catchment under the emission scenario RCP8.5 are evaluated by three different drought indices covering soil moisture, groundwater and streamflow deficits. The indices are based on results from a hydrological model forced by downscaled climate outputs from 16 Euro-CORDEX climate models (GCM-RCMs), while considering uncertainties among climate model projections. The hydrological model demonstrated a satisfactory ability in modelling historical drought characteristics. The results from the future projections showed that the intensity and frequency of droughts increased towards the end of the century. The spatial patterns of changes in drought were found to be highly dependent on the climate model results, index formulations and assumptions, as well as the hydrogeological properties of the catchment. Groundwater based irrigation in the agricultural areas effectively mitigates soil moisture drought, leading to lower future uncertainty of the ensemble mean (higher model agreement) for soil moisture droughts at irrigated locations. This is obtained at the cost of lower groundwater levels in both reference and future periods resulting in larger uncertainties on the simulated groundwater droughts, because of the addition of irrigation uncertainty. While the joint impact of greater groundwater abstraction and changing dynamics of precipitation and groundwater recharge also leads to larger streamflow variability between model combinations (standard deviation) under RCP8.5 for the downstream discharge station.",0,0,"diverse"

Thus, detailed studies are needed to assess the littoral CH4 emissions in a regional scale. In this study, CH4 fluxes were followed during the ice-free seasons in 1998 and 1999 by using the static chamber method in the littoral zone of two lakes in Finland. An exceptionally high water level in 1998 caused an unusually long inundation in otherwise ephemerally flooded zone. The flooding was normal in year 1999. The factors controlling CH4 emissions were examined and statistical response functions were constructed. Further, the effect of extended flooding on the littoral CH4 budged was estimated. The methane flux was primarily regulated by the water level in grass and sedge dominated eulittoral zone, but not in infralittoral reed and water lily stands. Methane emissions in the sedge dominated zone decreased significantly, when the flood was high enough to submerge the venting structures of the plants. Besides water level, sediment temperature determined CH4 emission. The cumulative CH4 emissions from the whole littoral wetlands in wet year were 1.1 times (L. Kevaton), or 0.61 and 0.79 times (L. Mekrijarvi) those in dry year. The crucial factor was the discrepancy between the exceptional and the average water level. The extension of inundated area does not necessarily increase CH4 emissions if the flood reaches infrequently inundated areas, which apparently have low CH4 production potential. This is the case especially, if the emissions in lower zones simultaneously decrease due to high water level. Our study analyses these complex responses between CH4 emissions and water level.",0,0,"diverse"

In the pancreas GCK regulates insulin secretion, while in the liver it promotes glucose utilization and storage. We showed that silencing the Drosophila GCK orthologs Hex-A and Hex-C results in a MODY-2-like hyperglycemia. Targeted knock-down revealed that Hex-A is expressed in insulin producing cells (IPCs) whereas Hex-C is specifically expressed in the fat body. We showed that Hex-A is essential for insulin secretion and it is required for Hex-C expression. Reduced levels of either Hex-A or Hex-C resulted in chromosome aberrations (CABs), together with an increased production of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). This result suggests that CABs, in GCK depleted cells, are likely due to hyperglycemia, which produces oxidative stress through AGE metabolism. In agreement with this hypothesis, treating GCK-depleted larvae with the antioxidant vitamin B6 rescued CABs, whereas the treatment with a B6 inhibitor enhanced genomic instability. Although MODY-2 rarely produces complications, our data revealed the possibility that MODY-2 impacts genome integrity.",0,0,"diverse"
"41","WOS:000265487800026","Role of Human-Mediated Dispersal in the Spread of the Pinewood Nematode in China","Background: Intensification of world trade is responsible for an increase in the number of alien species introductions. Human-mediated dispersal promotes not only introductions but also expansion of the species distribution via long-distance dispersal. Thus, understanding the role of anthropogenic pathways in the spread of invading species has become one of the most important challenges nowadays. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analysed the invasion pattern of the pinewood nematode in China based on invasion data from 1982 to 2005 and monitoring data on 7 locations over 15 years. Short distance spread mediated by long-horned beetles was estimated at 7.5 km per year. Infested sites located further away represented more than 90% of observations and the mean long distance spread was estimated at 111-339 km. Railways, river ports, and lakes had significant effects on the spread pattern. Human population density levels explained 87% of the variation in the invasion probability (P<0.05). Since 2001, the number of new records of the nematode was multiplied by a factor of 5 and the spread distance by a factor of 2. We combined a diffusion model to describe the short distance spread with a stochastic, individual based model to describe the long distance jumps. This combined model generated an error of only 13% when used to predict the presence of the nematode. Under two climate scenarios (stable climate or moderate warming), projections of the invasion probability suggest that this pest could expand its distribution 40-55% by 2025. Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that human-induced dispersal plays a fundamental role in the spread of the pinewood nematode, and appropriate control measures should be taken to stop or slow its expansion. This model can be applied to Europe, where the nematode had been introduced later, and is currently expanding its distribution. Similar models could also be derived for other species that could be accidentally transported by humans.",0,0,"diverse"

We investigated factors potentially contributing to the lack of angling-sized yellow perch in Dore Lake, Saskatchewan. This large boreal lake has a long history of exploitation and is subject to current controversy regarding the impact of double-crested cormorants Phalacrocorax auritus on its fisheries. We found that yellow perch in Dore Lake attained greater maximum ages (mean +/- SD = 7.4 +/- 1.0 years) but smaller maximum sizes (215 +/- 7 mm TL) than other yellow perch populations. Thus, the lack of angling-sized yellow perch in Dore Lake is probably the result of slow growth rates rather than short life spans. Double-crested cormorants preyed heavily on yellow perch, but predation was highly skewed toward much smaller sizes (<100 mm TL) than those preferred by anglers. Stomach contents and stable nitrogen isotopes confirmed that yellow perch in Dore Lake undergo expected ontogenetic diet shifts and become predominantly piscivorous at around age 3. Analysis with stable isotopes also revealed long-term dietary differences between age-2 and age-3 yellow perch captured in littoral versus offshore habitats, suggesting some degree of intrapopulation variability in resource and habitat use among yellow perch in Dore Lake.",0,0,"diverse"

Until recently, there has been an implicit assumption that childhood learning involved primarily parent-child interactions. Building on current research that has begun to improve understanding of Indigenous socialization strategies, we apply a multi-scalar decorative analysis to investigate traditions of learning among potting communities in Southern Ontario and upstate New York, fromca.900-1650 CE. Through a series of statistical analyses, we demonstrate a remarkable continuity in motif practices by child potters that is not evident among skilled potters, who were more impacted by social, demographic, and economic changes in their communities. The multi-generational tradition spanning at least 750 years leads us to suggest that child potters learned primarily in child groups through peer-to-peer learning. Although peer-to-peer learning has been observed ethnographically, this practice has often been overlooked in archaeology and warrants further inquiry.",0,0,"diverse"

Yet, there is little evidence for the counterpart that profuse resources during early development may prove detrimental in an impoverished adult environment. Using birth season as a proxy for nutrition in utero, this study tests whether early life effects on longevity are conditional on the environment in which people reside during adulthood. Methods: I used Cox proportional hazard models of mortality after the age of 60 years among historical cohorts of French Canadian women born before 1750. Models are stratified by siblings to adjust the results for unobserved factors shared by family members. Results: A birth during winter conferred the best-survival prospects in the south of the Saint-Lawrence River but the worse prospects in the north, where a birth during the fall was associated with the lowest mortality. Women who migrated to live on the other side of the river lost whatever advantage or disadvantage they had from their birth season and faced increases or decreases in risk that were specific to their new location. Conclusions: Based on Hales and Barker's thrifty phenotype hypothesis, and adding the hopeful phenotype counterpart, this study suggests that cues from the external environment during development are highly specific to that environment and that the slightest change of location may affect the chances for survival into old age.

Methodology/Principal Findings: In vitro studies showed that DHA strongly reduces the viability and DNA synthesis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in culture, and also promotes cell death via apoptosis. Mechanistically, accumulation of reactive oxygen species and activation of caspase 8 contribute critically to the induction of apoptotic cell death. Co-presence of antioxidants or selective inhibition or knockdown of caspase 8 each effectively abrogates the cytotoxic effect of DHA. Using athymic nude mice as an in vivo model, we found that feeding animals the 5% fish oil-supplemented diet for 6 weeks significantly reduces the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells in vivo through inhibition of cancer cell proliferation as well as promotion of cell death. Using 3-nitrotyrosine as a parameter, we confirmed that the fish oil-supplemented diet significantly increases oxidative stress in tumor cells in vivo. Analysis of fatty acid content in plasma and tissues showed that feeding animals a 5% fish oil diet increases the levels of DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid in both normal and tumorous mammary tissues by 329% and 300%, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: DHA can strongly induce apoptosis in human MCF-7 breast cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. The induction of apoptosis in these cells is selectively mediated via caspase 8 activation. These observations call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of fish oil as a dietary supplement in the prevention and treatment of human breast cancer.",0,0,"diverse"

An accurate estimate of forest carbon sequestration over different forest and forest product combinations requires the species-specific and site-specific allometric biomass equations for trees and understory vegetation at particular forest developmental stages. Here, we constructed the above- and below-ground allometric equations by harvesting 108 20-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) trees grown under four different silvicultural treatments (four combinations of with and without competing vegetation control (H) and fertilization (F): C = control with no vegetation control and no fertilization, H, F, and HF) at three diverse site conditions in northern California. We found that the logarithmic regressions provided superior estimations of biomass for total, aboveground, bole, coarse roots, branches, and foliage compared to simple or scaled power-law fits. Treatment effect in allometric equations was generally lacking but site effect was significant, suggesting site specific allometric relations exist. With the best allometric equations, we estimated the biomass and carbon for each plot among treatments and sites. In addition, understory woody plant biomass was also measured with fixed area subplots. Results show significantly more total carbon sequestration at the high-quality sites with 113.1-162.5 Mg ha(-1) than the lower ones with 85.8-105.9 Mg ha(-1) at the intermediate site and 29.3-70.4 Mg ha(-1) at the poorest site, respectively. The range of carbon stocks indicates the treatment differences at each site, with the largest effect (240%) at the poorest site and similar at other two sites (similar to 130%). If planted trees only were considered, a trend among sites exists with 93.4-149.3 Mg ha(-1) at the richest site, 26.2-88.1 Mg ha(-1) at the intermediate site, and 17.1-64.2 Mg ha(-1) at the poorest site, respectively.

However, its growth retardant have brought serious economic losses in recent years. Antibiotics abuse is suggested as a reason for M. rosenbergii's growth retardant, while few studies focused on the toxic effect of antibiotics on M. rosenbergii. To investigate the effect of enrofloxacin, a widely used antibiotic, on juvenile M. rosenbergii, a 14 days exposure study was carried out within 0.2, 1 and 5 mg/L enrofloxacin and followed by 7 days decontamination. Results showed that during the test period, enrofloxacin had the largest accumulation in juvenile shrimp at day 3, and gradually decreased at day 7 and 14, and almost all the drugs are cleared after 3 days decontamination. Shortterm exposure to low dose enrofloxacin can promote the growth of juveniles. High dose enrofloxacin inhibited the growth of juvenile shrimp, to gill and liver damage, and induced apoptosis of the hepatopancreatic cells. These adverse effects was possibly caused by enrofloxacin-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, we also found the damage caused by high concentrations of enrofloxacin was irreversible in the short term. Collectively, these data indicated that enrofloxacin did affect the juvenile shrimp growth and development, and high level enrofloxacin abuse may contributed to M. rosenbergii's growth retardant.",0,0,"diverse"

Herbivores and parasites are likely to impose less damage on their host when their growth rate is slow and their dependency on the host is high. Accordingly, it was hypothesised that evolution would favour neutral or even beneficial interactions between a below-ground herbivore and a plant during the harsh season in a desert ecosystem. 2. This study characterised the relationship between the summer annual plant Salsola inermis Forssk (Chenopodiaceae) and weevils developing in a mud chamber attached to its roots in the Negev Desert of Israel. Plant seedlings were exposed to adult weevils (Conorhynchus palumbus Olivier or Menecleonus virgatus Schoenherr; Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in a controlled outside setting, to induce oviposition and larval establishment. The following were quantified: plant growth, above-ground biomass, fruit biomass, and fruit size, as well as relative C and N contents, and isotopic signatures (delta C-13 and delta N-15) in plant tissues. 3. Exposure to weevils did not reduce plant survival but significantly and negatively affected plant growth and seed production. However, these effects were mainly due to above-ground herbivory by adults rather than root herbivory by larvae, and might have been overestimated. Interestingly, %N and delta N-15 were significantly higher, and the C:N ratio was significantly lower, in plants with larval establishment, suggesting that weevils affect the plant nitrogen budget. 4. The overall results do not support the notion of mutualistic interactions; yet, slow consumption, a low infestation level, and, possibly, N supplementation to the plant may enable the plant to tolerate herbivory under natural conditions.",0,0,"diverse"

This allows us to apply the attack to it wider class of stream ciphers. Second, we highlight how the choice of different Maiorana-McFarland functions can affect the effectiveness of our attack. Third, we show, that the attack can be modified to apply on filter functions which are smaller than the LFSR and on filter-combiner stream ciphers. This allows us to cryptanalyze other configurations commonly found in practice. Finally, filter functions with vector output are sometimes used in stream ciphers to improve the throughput. Therefore the case when the Maiorana-McFarland functions have vector output is investigated.

The prepared Bi2WO6/N-SrTiO3 was assembled from massive N-SrTiO3 nanoballs segmented via 2D interlaced nanosheets of Bi2WO6. N-SrTiO3 on its own has good reductive ability and can easily reduce Cr(VI) ions, while Bi2WO6 has been demonstrated to have good oxidative ability to oxidize tetracycline under visible light irradiation. Importantly, mixed contaminants (TC and Cr6+ ions) could be completely removed under visible light by the assembled Bi2WO6/N-SrTiO3 material. It is proposed that the holes lying at the valence band of N-SrTiO3 are the main active species for the oxidation of tetracycline, while the electrons located at the conduction band of Bi2WO6 are mainly responsible for the reduction of Cr(VI) ions. The matched band structures of Bi2WO6 and N-SrTiO3 were beneficial for inhibiting the recombination of electron-hole pairs and maintaining the redox capacity through a Z-type n-n heterojunction.

Results revealed that higher irradiance (230 mu mol s(-1) m(-2) vs. 113 mu mol s(-1) m(-2) at 2 m depth) had significant positive effects on submerged macrophyte growth: increasing the number of individuals (seven-fold), the number of species surviving (two-fold), aboveground biomass (11-fold), belowground biomass (10-fold), and total biomass (11-fold), whereas elevated sediment phosphorus (2.1-3.3 mg g(-1) vs. 0.7 mg g(-1) dry sediment) did not have any significant impact. However, responses to irradiance differ among macrophyte species due to their morphology and physiology. Waterweed increased in numbers of individuals and total biomass under high irradiance while biomass per individual remained the same (similar to 0.02 g). The other species increased both in numbers and biomass per individual. These results suggest that increased irradiance rather than decreased phosphorus loading is the main driver of changes in submerged macrophytes in North American temperate lake ecosystems.

LC50 values obtained for As3+ were elevated and remained within the range of 46 to 50 mg/L of As3+ between 4 and 17 d of exposure. Growth of tadpoles was completely inhibited with 30 mg/L of As3+, demonstrating the presence of ecologically relevant sublethal effects at concentrations lower than those resulting in lethality. With respect to Zn2+, a 96-h LC50 value of 2.49 mg/L was calculated in soft water. Contrary to results obtained for As3+, LC50 values of Zn2+ gradually decreased with increasing exposure duration, from 2.49 mg/L at 96 h to 1.30 mg/L after 21 d.

The immune function (plasma IgM, lysozyme activity and complement bacteriolytic activity), growth (body weight) and physiological condition (haematocrit and plasma protein concentration) of the fish were determined. Increased UVB level, regardless of water temperature, had a negative effect on immune function parameters, growth and physiological condition. Higher temperature increased plasma IgM concentration but had a negative effect on complement bacteriolytic activity under both spectral treatments. Increased temperature, irrespective of UVB level, increased fish growth but negatively affected haematocrit and plasma protein. Exposing the fish to enhanced UVB at elevated temperature increased plasma IgM concentration and slightly improved growth. However, complement activity and physiological condition parameters decreased more than when the fish were exposed to each stressor separately. The changes were mainly additive; no interactive or synergistic effects were observed. The negative impact of multiple stressors on immune function, together with predicted increases in pathogen load in warmer waters resulting from global climate change, suggest an increased risk to diseases in fishes.

Using a 2 x 3 factorial design, the effects of round gobies (present or absent) and zebra mussel densities (zero, low and high) on non-mussel invertebrates was examined. Ten ceramic tiles of each mussel density were colonized in the laboratory and then anchored in Calumet Harbour, IL for 10 weeks. Round gobies had access to half the tiles while half were covered with coarse mesh screening that excluded round gobies, had access to half the tiles while half were covered with coarse mesh screening that excluded round gobies, but allowed invertebrates to move into and out of the exclosures.

Degradation of freshwater ecosystems is a major concern worldwide. Agriculture introduces multiple stressors to streams, presenting a challenge for freshwater managers who must understand the relative strengths of individual stressor effects and their combined multiple-stressor effects. 2. Using a replicated regression design, we manipulated levels of fine sediment and nutrients to create a broad eight-point gradient for each stressor across 128 stream mesocosms to determine the shapes of macroinvertebrate responses after 21 days of exposure. 3. Subsidystress response patterns occurred along both stressor gradients. Sediment addition provided an initial subsidy for some pollution-tolerant taxa and total macroinvertebrate density, but produced consistently negative effects for other taxa, total taxon richness and the density and richness of pollution-sensitive Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera (EPT) taxa. Nutrient enrichment provided an initial subsidy for densities of two common EPT taxa, total EPT density, macroinvertebrate and EPT taxon richness. 4. Few macroinvertebrate variables were affected by a single stressor (always fine sediment). The majority of responses were additive multiple-stressor patterns, although Chironomidae density and EPT taxon richness followed complex synergistic patterns. 5. Fine sediment was a much more pervasive stressor than augmented nutrient concentrations. Overall, macroinvertebrate traits responded to stressors as strongly as community variables or individual taxa. 6. Synthesis and applications. Managing both fine sediment and nutrient inputs from agriculture is crucial to achieve good stream condition but priority should be given to minimizing fine sediment, which should be maintained below a threshold of 5% cover and 0.5-mm depth.

Among 139 wetlands, nonnative fish (bass, sunfish, and mosquitofish) negatively influenced the probability of occupancy of Pacific treefrogs (Pseudacris regilla), but neither invader correlated strongly with occupancy by California newts (Taricha torosa), western toads (Anaxyrus boreas), or California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii). In mesocosms, mosquitofish dramatically reduced the abundance of zooplankton and palatable amphibian larvae (P. regilla and T. torosa), leading to increases in nutrient concentrations and phytoplankton (through loss of zooplankton), and rapid growth of unpalatable toad larvae (through competitive release). Bullfrog larvae reduced the growth of native anurans but had no effect on survival.

Elevated allochthonous inputs of nutrients and sediments to aquatic ecosystems are associated with eutrophication and sedimentation. Reservoirs receive substantial subsidies of nutrients and sediments from catchments due to their large catchment : lake area ratios. We examined the effect of elevated subsidies of sediments and/or dissolved nutrients on the success (survival, growth, biomass and condition factor) of larval gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), a widespread and dominant omnivorous fish in reservoir ecosystems. 2. We simulated allochthonous agricultural subsides by manipulating dissolved nutrients and sediment inputs in a 2 x 2 factorial design in experimental mesocosms. We predicted that larval fish success would be greater under elevated nutrients. However, we propose two alternative hypotheses with respect to the overall effect of allochthonous sediment inputs. If sediment inputs negatively affect larval gizzard feeding success, larval success would be highest when only nutrients are added and lowest when only sediments are added (+N > +N+S >= C > +S). If high turbidity enhances larval foraging activity (due to greater contrast between prey and background), we predict that larval success would be highest when both subsidy types (nutrients and sediment) are elevated, intermediate when either nutrients or sediments are added and the lowest when no subsidies are added (+N+S > +N >= +S > C). 3. Our results indicate that elevated nutrient and sediment conditions enhanced larval gizzard shad biomass, but the overall nutrient addition effect was greater than the sediment addition effect (+N similar to +N+S > +S > C). We observed differential effects of nutrient and sediment inputs on larval survival, growth and condition factors. 4. The enhancement of fish biomass in elevated nutrients (+N, +N+S) relative to control conditions was associated with improved gizzard shad survival and not greater growth. The enhancement of fish biomass in the elevated sediment treatment (+S) relative to the control conditions was caused by an increase in survival that more than compensated for a negative effect of sediment addition on growth. 5. Our findings support the recommendation that reservoir management practices must consider the links between land use practices and food web dynamics. Our results suggest that reduction of subsidies of nutrients and sediments to productive reservoirs would decrease survival of larval gizzard shad due to lower food availability.",1,1,"diverse"
"60","WOS:000285855100011","Effects of an Insecticide and Potential Predators on Green Frogs and Northern Cricket Frogs","Worldwide amphibian population declines have occurred in the last few decades and have been attributed to a range of factors including introduced species and chemical contamination. Anuran species may differ in their susceptibility to declines based on life-history characteristics, leading to different probabilities of decline and conservation statuses. In this experiment, we looked at two anuran species, Northern Cricket Frogs (Acris crepitans) and Green Frogs (Rana clamitans), reared in mesocosms containing a common invasive or introduced potential predator (Rusty Crayfish, Bluegill Sunfish, or triploid Grass Carp) and imidacloprid, a common insecticide. We found that anurans differed in their sensitivity to these factors. Cricket Frog survival was significantly reduced with imidacloprid exposure, whereas Green Frogs were not. Abundance of both amphibian species was reduced in the presence of predators, particularly the fish. Our study suggests that Cricket Frogs may be especially sensitive to the insecticide imidacloprid, as well as fish predators, and that these factors could contribute to their population declines.",1,1,"diverse"

Amphibians appear to be particularly susceptible to these stressors. We conducted a mesocosm experiment to examine the independent and interactive effects of an invasive fish, the Western Mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis), and ammonium nitrate, an agricultural fertilizer, on American Toad (Anaxyrus americanus) tadpoles. Mosquitofish tended to have a negative effect on American Toad survivorship. American Toad metamorphs from mesocosms with mosquitofish were smaller than those from mesocosms without mosquitofish. Mosquitofish also delayed metamorphosis of the American Toads. Ammonium nitrate addition did not affect survivorship. However, American Toad metamorphs from ammonium nitrate addition treatments were smaller than those from treatments without ammonium nitrate addition. Mosquitofish and ammonium nitrate addition each had independent effects on American Toads, but there was no evidence for significant interactions between these two stressors.",1,1,"diverse"

A pH of 6.9 was used as a control. The experiment was performed at two test temperatures, 13 and 3 degreesC. After 1 week of exposure, half of the fish in the tank were taken for oxygen measurement and tissue sampling. The remaining half were maintained in metal-free water for a further week to assess their recovery at the two test temperatures. Fifty percent of the fish died under metal exposure at 13 degreesC, but none at 3 degreesC. Despite of the lack of mortalities at the lower temperature, surviving fish at both test temperatures suffered similar gill damage (adherence of lamellae), disturbances in ion regulation, increases in haematocrit value (Hct) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration and reductions in oxygen consumption. The addition of humic acid prevented these changes. The reduced plasma chloride concentration, increased blood Het value and Hb concentration recovered completely at 13 degreesC, whereas the lowered oxygen consumption recovered less completely, which may be attributed to the remaining minor gill damage (lamellar hypertrophy). At the lower temperature, the adherence of lamellae persisted after the recovery period, and oxygen consumption, therefore, remained at a very low level. The decreased plasma chloride concentration was also unable to recover. The accumulation of Al inside the gill tissue was greater at low temperature. We conclude that the acute toxicity of a mixture of Fe and Al to grayling and their subsequent ability to recovery is dependent on the exposure temperature. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Interactive UVR x nutrient effects on structural and functional variables (algal biomass, chlorophyll a (chl a), primary production (PP), maximal electron transport rate (ETRmax), and alkaline phosphatase activity (APA)), as well as stoichiometric ones (sestonic N per cell and N : P ratio) were found. Under non-nutrient enriched conditions, no deleterious effects of UVR on structural variables, PP, photosynthetic efficiency and ETRmax were observed, whereas only particulate and total APA were affected by UVR. However, percentage excreted organic carbon (%EOC), dissolved APA and sestonic C and P per cell increased under UVR, leading to a decrease in algal C : P and N : P ratios. After nutrient enrichment, chl a, total algal biomass and PP were negatively affected by UVR whereas %EOC, ETRmax and internal C, P and N content increased. We suggest that the mechanism of algal acclimation to UVR in this high UVR flux ecosystem seems to be related to the increase of internal algal P-content mediated by physiological mechanisms to save P and by a stimulatory UVR effect on dissolved extracellular APA. The mechanism involved in the unmasking effect of UVR after nutrient-enrichment may be the result of a greater sensitivity to UVR-induced cell damage, making the negative UVR effects more evident.",1,1,"diverse"

We hypothesized that warming increases invasion of alpine lakes by low-elevation montane zooplankton by suppressing native competitors and predators. This hypothesis was tested by conducting a two-factor experiment, consisting of a warming treatment (13 vs. 20 degrees C) crossed with three invasion levels (alpine only, alpine+montane, montane only), in growth chambers over a 28-day period. Warming significantly reduced total consumer biomass owing to the decline of large alpine species, resulting in greater autotrophic abundance. Significant temperature-invasion interactions occurred as warming suppressed alpine zooplankton, while stimulating certain imported species. Herbivorous invaders suppressed functionally similar alpine species while larger native omnivores reduced invasion by smaller taxa. Warming did not affect total invader biomass because imported species thrived under ambient and warmed alpine conditions. Our findings suggest that the adaptability of remote alpine lake communities to global warming is limited by species dispersal from lower valleys, or possibly nearby warmer alpine ponds.",1,1,"diverse"

Freshly fallen leaves were immersed in a stream to allow microbial colonization, and were exposed in microcosms to a gradient of cadmium (<= 11 levels, <= 35 mg L-1). Microcosms were kept at 15 degrees C, a temperature typically found in Iberian streams in autumn, and at 21 degrees C to simulate a warming scenario. The increase in temperature stimulated leaf decomposition by microbes, fungal reproduction and leaf consumption by the shredder. Conversely, increased cadmium concentrations inhibited fungal reproduction and diversity, and leaf consumption by the invertebrate. Cadmium concentration inhibiting 50% of fungal reproduction, microbial decomposition and leaf consumption by the shredder was higher at 15 degrees C than at 21 degrees C, suggesting that higher temperatures can lead to increased metal toxicity to aquatic decomposers.

Although Cu is acquired by fish by either water or diet, studies that have investigated Cu impacts in fish have mainly focused on the toxicity of waterborne Cu. Moreover, as the majority of experiments were carried out under simplified conditions, little is known about the effects of natural factors other than competitive ions on Cu toxicity in fish. As temperature is a primary factor that affects the physiological state of poikilotherm organisms, we investigated the individual and combined effects of temperature and waterborne or dietary Cu on fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Fish were exposed to environmentally realistic concentrations of waterborne or dietary Cu at 20 degrees C and 32 degrees C. Transcriptional and enzymatic responses of various indicators of metabolic capacities as well as indicators of heat, oxidative and metal stresses were measured in fish muscle. Under our experimental conditions, temperature was the most important factor affecting the general condition of fish. Although no significant Cu accumulation was observed in the muscle of Cu-exposed fish, at 20 degrees C, waterborne and dietary Cu triggered significant changes in the transcription level of genes encoding for proteins involved in energy metabolism, metal detoxification and protein protection. Moreover, the response was quantitatively more important for dietary Cu than for waterborne Cu. Combined exposure to heat and Cu triggered the most significant changes in gene transcription levels and enzyme activities. During combined exposure to heat and Cu, in addition to synergistic effects of the two factors, both waterborne and dietary Cu impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to curb heat stress. Reciprocally, temperature impaired the adaptive response developed by fish to combat Cu toxicity. These results suggest that wild fish populations subjected to elevated temperatures due to seasonal warming or global climate change may become more susceptible to Cu pollution, and vice versa.

Minor differences in these factors can affect periphyton, which are key functional communities in these ecosystems. Eight different environmental conditions combining two types of current, two flow velocities and two light intensities were produced and controlled in artificial channels. Their impact on young and mature periphyton was investigated during a 6-week exposure period. The two different levels of light intensity produced early effects on the algal community. In young periphyton, the lower level of light intensity enhanced the number of algal cells, and this community appeared to be significantly structured by light. As the periphyton matured, the effects of physical factors became more marked. At this later stage, both the bacterial and algal communities began to be affected. Both function (primary production) and structure began to respond to differences in light and in flow velocity. Small differences in low-level environmental factors, such as light and flow, had an effect both on the structure of periphyton and its functional capacities. Keeping in mind the close link between diversity and function in microbial communities, periphyton confronted to various environmental stresses (pollution, flooding) in the field may behave differently due to minor differences in physical factors.",1,1,"diverse"
"69","WOS:000282278200002","Interactions among temporal patterns determine the effects of multiple stressors","Recent research has revealed that one of the most important characteristics of both natural and anthropogenic disturbances is their temporal heterogeneity. However, little is known about the relative importance of interactions among temporal patterns of multiple stressors. We established a fully factorial field experiment to test whether interactions among temporal patterns of two globally important anthropogenic disturbances of aquatic ecosystems (increased sediment loading and nutrient enrichment) determined the responses of stream benthic assemblages. Each disturbance treatment comprised three distinct regimes: regular and temporally variable pulses and an undisturbed control. The overall frequency, intensity and extent of disturbance was, however, equal across all disturbed treatments. We found that interactions among temporal disturbance regimes determined the effects of the compounded sediment and nutrient perturbations on algal biomass and the diversity, taxonomic and trophic composition of benthic assemblages. Moreover, our results also show that the temporal synchronization of multiple stressors does not necessarily maximize the impact of compounded perturbations. This comprises the first experimental evidence that interactions among the temporal patterns of disturbances drive the responses of ecosystems to multiple stressors. Knowledge of the temporal pattern of disturbances is therefore essential for the reliable prediction of impacts from, and effective management of, compounded perturbations.",1,1,"diverse"

Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) (exposed or blocked), temperature (6 degrees C and 14 degrees C), and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and nitrogen plus phosphor-us) were manipulated in a factorial design to determine how these factors interact to affect phytoplankton growth. Four major phytoplankton taxa (two diatoms, one chrysophyte, and one dinoflagellate) were found in the water samples across all treatments. Greater growth rates were observed at the higher temperature for all taxa, except the chrysophyte. UVR depressed the growth rates of all phytoplankton at 6 degrees C regardless of nutrient conditions. In contrast, at 14 degrees C, a negative effect of UVR was not observed for any species in the absence of nutrient additions; only with the addition of nutrients did UVR exposure depress the growth of one diatom species and the dinoflagellate. Our results suggest that in alpine lakes, the effects of UVR exposure on phytoplankton depend on temperature and nutrient availability, indicating that climate change and enhanced atmospheric nitrogen deposition are likely to alter UV-temperature-nutrient relationships of plankton in high-UV systems.",1,1,"diverse"

Productivity and grazing pressure interact in determining autotroph diversity, because high productivity increases the capability of a plant community to compensate for grazing losses. However, further factors may play a role in shaping diversity, including primary producer nutrient stoichiometry and grazer activity. 2. Our study focuses on the interactions between light, nutrients and grazing in determining species richness and evenness of stream diatoms. By measuring primary producer productivity and nutrient content as well as grazer activity, we attempt to disentangle the different pathways by which the three factors affect diatom species richness and evenness. 3. We hypothesized that high light intensities and nutrient addition would increase species richness by increasing primary productivity and that higher levels of light and nutrients would compensate for negative grazer effects on species richness of primary producers. We also hypothesized that high light intensities would decrease the nutrient content of primary producers, especially when nutrients are limiting, whereas nutrient addition would increase primary producer nutrient content. Last, in addition to changing primary producer nutrient content, light and nutrients would also change grazer activity, thus modifying the interactions between light, nutrients and grazing. 4. We used periphyton and gastropod grazers in an experiment with circular stream channels with four nutrient, two light and four grazing levels to determine individual and combined effects on benthic diatom richness and evenness. After 3 weeks, we determined algal biomass, periphyton nutrient content, diatom species richness and evenness as well as grazer activity. 5. Our results showed that light and nutrients increased species richness and primary producer productivity and nutrient content. Grazing decreased species richness but only at low light levels, possibly because high light levels reduced grazer activity. Evenness was not affected by any single factor alone, but was influenced by nutrient-light and grazing-light interactions. 6. Synthesis.

A 28-day experiment in outdoor stream mesocosms examined the effects of four levels each of fine sediment coverage (0, 25, 75, 100%) and glyphosate-based herbicide concentration (0, 50, 200, 370 mu g/L) on periphyton communities (algae and bacteria) in a fully factorial, repeated-measures design. Our aims were to determine whether (i) increased levels of sediment and glyphosate had individual and/or additive effects, (ii) increased sediment reduced the toxicity of glyphosate (antagonistic multiple stressor interaction), or (iii) sediment-adsorbed glyphosate prolonged the effects of exposure (synergistic interaction). We also assigned all algal taxa to three ecological guilds (low-profile, high-profile and motile growth forms) and separately determined their responses to the treatments. As individual stressors, sediment addition affected all algal community-level metrics, whereas glyphosate addition only affected algal community evenness. Bacterial taxon richness was unaffected by either stressor. In combination, however, significant overall sediment by glyphosate interactions were detected, demonstrating synergistic (algal evenness, high-profile and motile guilds) or antagonistic effects (low-profile guild). Our experiment underscores the importance of considering both structural and functional indicators, including algal guild representation, when assessing the mechanisms by which periphyton communities respond to multiple stressors.

Initial screening, in nutrient broth, of all products with all strains revealed little variation between strains in respect of maximum inhibitory and bactericidal dilutions of each product. However, between the products there was wide and significant variation in the maximum inhibitory and bactericidal dilutions, spanning a 700-fold range in the case of bactericidal dilutions for feed-associated products. Further tests were performed, examining reductions in inoculated Salmonella numbers in various matrices (water, feed, soiled litter, crop and caecal contents) following the addition of the products at recommended inclusion rates. One product, incorporating formaldehyde in addition to organic acid, was consistently most active in all matrices, exceeding reductions associated with other products by 1 to 3 log units at most time points. Many products showed only modest anti-Salmonella activity, amounting to 0 or 1 log unit above negative controls at many time points, and the most active products were not the same in all matrices.

In this study, we selected two large forested watersheds (Pingjiang and Xiangshui) located in the upper reach of the Poyang Lake watershed, southeastern China (with an area of 3261.4 and 1458 km(2), respectively), along with long-term data on climate and hydrology (1954-2006) to assess the effects of large-scale reforestation on streamflow. Both watersheds have similar climate and experienced comparable and dramatic forest changes during the past decades, but with different watershed properties (e.g., the topography is much steeper in Xiangshui than in Pingjiang), which provides us with a unique opportunity to compare the differences in hydrological recovery in two contrasted watersheds. Streamflow at different percentiles (e.g., 5, 10, 50 and 95 %) were compared using a combination of statistical analysis with a year-wise method for each watershed. The results showed that forest recovery had no significant effects on median flows (Q(50%)) in both watersheds. However, reforestation significantly reduced high flows in Pingjiang, but had limited influence in Xiangshui. Similarly, reforestation had significant and positive effects on low flows (Q(95%)) in Pingjiang, while it did not significantly change low flows in Xiangshui. Thus, hydrological recovery is limited and slower in the steeper Xiangshui watershed, highlighting that watershed properties are also important for determining hydrological responses to reforestation.

This study examined the gonadal histology and sex ratios of reciprocal hybrids that were reared at 15, 17, 21, 25 or 29 degrees C during the sex differentiation period. The genetic sex of hybrids from O. hatcheri fathers was inferred from a sex-linked SNP marker. Both hybrids showed female-biased sex ratios at the lowest temperature, female-biased to balanced sex ratios at intermediate temperatures and balanced or male-biased sex ratios at 29 degrees C, but unlike in purebred O. bonariensis, the lowest and highest temperatures did not yield monosex populations. The proportion of females in the offspring was affected more by parental genome than by hybrid combination. Female hybrids bearing the O. hatcheri Y chromosome showed temporary arrest of ovarian development that was rescued in adults.

In the current study, MeHg exposure (0.01 mM via drinking water) significantly inhibited the lymphoproliferation and NK cells functions of the female Balb/c mice, while dietary Se supplementation (as Se-rich yeast) partly or fully recovered the observed immunotoxicity, indicating the protective role of Se against MeHg-induced immune suppression in mice. Besides, MeHg exposure promoted the generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), reduced the levels of nonenzymic and enzymic antioxidants in target organs, while dietary Se administration significantly diminished the MeHg-induced oxidative stress and subsequent cellular dysfunctions (lipid peroxidation and protein oxidation). Two possible mechanisms of Se's protective effects were further revealed. Firstly, the reduction of mercury concentrations (less than 25%, modulated by Se supplementation) in the target organs might contribute, but not fully explain the alleviated immune suppression. Secondly and more importantly, Se could help to maintain/or elevate the activities of several key antioxidants, therefore protect the immune cells against MeHg-induced oxidative damage.

Water was analyzed for viable F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-specific RNA (F-RNA) (genogroup I [GI] to GIV) coliphage and a suite of molecularly detected viruses (norovirus [GI to GIV], torque teno virus [TTV], rotavirus, kobuvirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E). F-DNA and F-RNA coliphage were detected in 33 and 28% of the samples at maximum concentrations of 2,000 and 16,300 PFU . 100 ml(-1), respectively. Animal TTV, human TTV, kobuvirus, astrovirus, and norovirus GIII were the most prevalent viruses, found in 23, 20, 13, 12, and 11% of samples, respectively. Viable F-DNA coliphage was found to be a modest positive indicator of molecularly detected TTV. F-RNA coliphage, unlike F-DNA coliphage, was a modest positive predictor of norovirus and rotavirus. There were, however, a number of significant negative associations among F-specific coliphage and viruses. F-DNA coliphage densities of >142 PFU . 100 ml(-1) delineated conditions when similar to 95% of water samples contained some type of virus. Kobuvirus was the virus most strongly related to detection of any other virus. Land use had some associations with virus/F-specific coliphage detection, but season and surface water flow were the variables that were most important for broadly delineating detection. Higher relative levels of detection of human viruses and human F-RNA coliphage were associated with higher relative degrees of upstream human land development in a catchment. IMPORTANCE This study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate relationships among F-specific coliphages and a large suite of enteric viruses in mixed-use but agriculturally dominated surface waters in Canada. This study suggested that relationships between viable F-specific coliphages and molecularly detected viruses do exist, but they are not always positive. Caution should be employed if viable F-specific coliphages are to be used as indicators of virus presence in surface waters.

Upon addition of the metal ion, the probe 1-containing solution vividly changed color, enabling visual detection of each metal ion (Cu2+ or Hg2+) without requiring any instruments. A ratiometric approach insensitive to environmental interference provided limit of detections (LODs) of 1.0 and 2.0 mu M for Cu2+ and Hg2+ sensing, respectively. The green fluorescence emission of probe 1 was entirely (Cu2+) or partially (Hg2+) quenched in the presence of the metal ion, yielding an observed fluorescence-based LOD (5/200 nM for Cu2+/Hg2+). Thus, probe 1 showed a dual responsiveness for detection of the metal ion. A model probe (2) with only a single metal binding site was ineffective at sensing the metal ion (Cu2+ or Hg2+) under the same conditions, demonstrating that the presence of the two binding sites in probe 1 is essential for the sensitive detection of the metal ion. The DFT calculations suggest binding of the metal ion to the probe with a stoichiometry of 1:1 or 2:1 (M2+ : probe).

Checks were artificial diet mixed with a botanical insecticide Margosom (R) 0.3% EC (active ingredient [AI] 250 ppm, azadirachtin), and diet plus only water. EAA at 250 and 1,000 ppm inhibited larval weight and prolonged larval development of C. decolora. EAA at 500 ppm and EACA at 1,500 ppm caused most deformation in pupae and adults. As many as 50% of C. decolora larvae occurred with EAA at 500-. EAA was the most active extract in laboratory tests and later evaluated at 250, 500, and 1,000 ppm applied to cabbage plants infested with C. decolora larvae in a greenhouse. Two checks were cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) plants without extract (water only) and pyrethroid insecticide (Alfadex (R) AI 21.29% cypermethrin) at 500 ppm. Gas chromatographymass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the acetonic extract of Jatropha curcas seed identified oleic acid as the major compound. EAA at 1,000 ppm and Alfadex were most effective at protecting cabbage plants from attack by larval C. decolora.",0,0,"biased"

For data-poor' stocks, vital rates may be estimated from empirical size-based relationships or from life-history invariants. However, a theoretical framework to synthesize these empirical relations is lacking. Here, we combine life-history invariants, metabolic scaling and size-spectrum theory to develop a general size- and trait-based theory for demography and recruitment of exploited fish stocks. Important concepts are physiological or metabolic scaled mortalities and flux of individuals or their biomass to size. The theory is based on classic metabolic relations at the individual level and uses asymptotic size W as a trait. The theory predicts fundamental similarities and differences between small and large species in vital rates and response to fishing. The central result is that larger species have a higher egg production per recruit than small species. This means that density dependence is stronger for large than for small species and has the consequence that fisheries reference points that incorporate recruitment do not obey metabolic scaling rules. This result implies that even though small species have a higher productivity than large species their resilience towards fishing is lower than expected from metabolic scaling rules. Further, we show that the fishing mortality leading to maximum yield per recruit is an ill-suited reference point. The theory can be used to generalize the impact of fishing across species and for making demographic and evolutionary impact assessments of fishing, particularly in data-poor situations.",0,0,"biased"

Consequently, a sustainable biofuel policy should consider: (a) how climate change would alter both water supply and demand; and (b) in turn, how related changes in water availability will impact the production of biofuel crops; and (c) the environmental implications of large scale biofuel productions. Understanding the role of biofuels in the water cycle is the key to understanding many of the environmental impacts of biofuels. Therefore, the focus of this study is to model the rarely explored interactions between land use, climate change, water resources and the environment in future biofuel production systems. Results from this study will help explore the impacts of the US biofuel policy and climate change on water and agricultural resources. We used the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to analyze the water quantity and quality consequences of land use and land management related changes in cropping conditions (e.g., more use of marginal lands, greater residue harvest, increased yields), plus management practices due to biofuel crops to meet the Renewable Fuel Standard target on water quality and quantity.",0,0,"biased"

Environmental concerns and insecticide selection-pressure have prompted investigations of novel, ecologically-harmless substances which can be used as insecticides. This study examined the efficacy of microencapsulated garlic-oil as the oral toxin component of ATSB for controlling Anopheles sergentii populations inhabiting desert-surrounded wetlands in Israel. ATSB solution containing 0.4% encapsulated garlic oil was applied to local vegetation around a streamlet located in the lower Jordan Valley. To determine the propensity of bait ingestion, and assess the potential ecological impact of the method, mosquito and non-target specimens were collected and tested for the presence of natural plant- or attractive sugar bait (ASB)-derived sugars. Over the experimental period, biting-pressure values in the ATSB treatment site decreased by 97.5%, while at the control site, treated with non-toxic ASB, no significant changes were observed. Approximately 70% of the mosquitoes collected before both treatments, as well as those captured following the application of ASB at the control site, were found to have ingested sugar prior to capture. Non-target insects were minimally affected by the treatment when ATSB was applied to foliage of non-flowering plants. Of the non-Diptera species, only 0.7% of the sampled non-target insects were found to have ingested ASB-solution which was applied to green vegetation, compared with 8.5% which have foraged on ASB-derived sugars applied to flowering plants. Conversely, a high proportion of the non-target species belonging to the order Diptera, especially non-biting midges, were found to have ingested foliage-applied ASB, with more than 36% of the specimens collected determined to have foraged on bait-derived sugars. These results prove that food-grade, EPA-exempt microencapsulated garlic oil is a highly effective insecticide which can be utilized for mosquito population control. The relatively short half-life of this active ingredient makes it a suitable for use in areas where repeated application is possible, limiting the accumulation of deleterious compounds and ensuring minimal environmental impact when applied in accordance with label recommendations.

"86","WOS:000311059800023","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dibutyl phthalate disrupt dorsal-ventral axis determination via the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in zebrafish embryos","The canonical canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway is critical during early teleost development for establishing the dorsal-ventral axis. Within this pathway, GSK-3 beta, a key regulatory kinase in the Wnt pathway, regulates P-catenin degradation and thus the ability of p-catenin to enter nuclei, where it can activate expression of genes that have been linked to the specification of the dorsal-ventral axis. In this study, we describe the morphological abnormalities that resulted in zebrafish embryos when axis determination was disrupted by environmental contaminants. These abnormalities were linked to abnormal nuclear accumulation of P-catenin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the developmental abnormalities and altered nuclear p-catenin accumulation occurred when embryos were exposed to commercial GSK-3 beta inhibitors. Zebrafish embryos were exposed to commercially available GSK-3 inhibitors (GSK-3 Inhibitor IX and 1-azakenpaullone), or common environmental contaminants (dibutyl phthalate or the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons phenanthrene and fluorene) from the 2 to 8-cell stage through the mid-blastula transition (MBT). These embryos displayed morphological abnormalities at 12.5 h post-fertilization (hpf) that were comparable to embryos exposed to lithium chloride (LiCl) (300 mM LiCl for 10 min, prior to the MBT), a classic disruptor of embryonic axis determination. Whole-mount immunolabeling and laser scanning confocal microscopy were used to localize P-catenin. The commercial GSK-3 Inhibitors as well as LiCl, dibutyl phthalate, fluorene and phenanthrene all induced an increase in the levels of nuclear p-catenin throughout the embryo, indicating that the morphological abnormalities were a result of disruption of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling during dorsal-ventral axis specification. The ability of environmental chemicals to directly or indirectly target GSK-3 beta was assessed. Using Western blot analysis, the ability of these chemicals to affect enzymatic inhibitory phosphorylation at serine 9 on GSK-3 beta was examined, but no change in the serine phosphorylation state of GSK-3 beta was detected in exposed embryos. Furthermore, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and dibutyl phthalate had no direct effect on the in vitro kinase activity of GSK-3 beta. While developmental abnormalities resulting from these axis-disrupting contaminants were linked to P-catenin accumulation in nuclei, the details of the disruption of this signaling pathway remain unknown. Since phenanthrene and fluorene as well as other hydrocarbons have been shown to disrupt axial development in sea urchin embryos, and since axis determination and the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway are highly conserved, we propose that these environmental contaminants may impact embryo development through a similar mechanism across phyla.

Despite long-term data collection over the nearly three decades since the spill, tremendous uncertainty remains as to how significantly the spill affected fishery resources. Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) and some wild Pacific salmon populations (Oncorhynchus spp.) in Prince William Sound declined in the early 1990s, and have not returned to the population sizes observed in the 1980s. Discerning if, or how much of, this decline resulted from the oil spill has been difficult because a number of other physical and ecological drivers are confounded temporally with the spill; some of these drivers include environmental variability or changing climate regimes, increased production of hatchery salmon in the region, and increases in populations of potential predators. Using data pre-and post-spill, we applied time-series methods to evaluate support for whether and how herring and salmon productivity has been affected by each of five drivers: (1) density dependence, (2) the EVOS event, (3) changing environmental conditions, (4) interspecific competition on juvenile fish, and (5) predation and competition from adult fish or, in the case of herring, humpback whales. Our results showed support for intraspecific density-dependent effects in herring, sockeye, and Chinook salmon, with little overall support for an oil spill effect. Of the salmon species, the largest driver was the negative impact of adult pink salmon returns on sockeye salmon productivity. Herring productivity was most strongly affected by changing environmental conditions; specifically, freshwater discharge into the Gulf of Alaska was linked to a series of recruitment failures-before, during, and after EVOS. These results highlight the need to better understand long terms impacts of pink salmon on food webs, as well as the interactions between nearshore species and freshwater inputs, particularly as they relate to climate change and increasing water temperatures.",0,0,"biased"

Herein, a novel phylloseptin peptide, named phylloseptin-PV1 (PPV1), is described from the defensive skin secretion of the Neotropical white-lined leaf frog, Phyllomedusa vaillantii. The peptide was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) and purified by RP-HPLC, prior to assessment of its biological activities. PPV1 not only demonstrated potent antimicrobial activity against planktonic ESKAPE microorganisms and the yeast, Candida albicans, but also inhibited and eradicated Staphylococcus aureus and MRSA biofilms. The antimicrobial mechanism was shown to include permeabilization of target cell membranes. The in vivo antimicrobial activity of the peptide was then evaluated using mice. PPV1 also exhibited antiproliferative activity against the cancer cell lines, H157, MCF-7, and U251MG, but had a lower potency against the normal cell line, HMEC-1. Although, the peptide possessed a moderate hemolytic action on mammalian red blood cells in vitro, it did not induce significant hepatic or renal toxicity in injected infected mice. These studies have thus found PPV1 to be a potent phylloseptin group AMP, which can effectively inhibit staphylococci, both in vitro and in vivo, without eliciting toxicity.

Climate change could increase the level of compound flood hazard through higher extreme sea levels and river flows. Here, a bivariate flood hazard assessment method is proposed to estimate compound coastal-riverine frequency under current and future climate conditions. A copula-based approach is used to estimate the joint return period (JRP) of compound floods by incorporating sea-level rise (SLR) and changes in peak river flows into the marginal distributions of flood drivers. Specifically, the changes in JRP of compound major coastal-riverine flooding defined based on simultaneous exceedances above major coastal and riverine thresholds, are explored by midcentury. Subsequently, the increase in the probability of occurrence of at least one compound major coastal-riverine flooding for a given period of time is quantified. The proposed compound flood hazard assessment is conducted at 26 paired tidal-riverine stations along the Contiguous United States coast with long-term data and defined flood thresholds. We show that the northeast Atlantic and the western part of the Gulf coasts are experiencing the highest compound major coastal-riverine flood probability under current conditions. However, future SLR scenarios show the highest frequency amplification along the southeast Atlantic coast. The impact of changes in peak river flows is found to be considerably less than that of SLR. Climate change impacts, especially SLR, may lead to more frequent compound events, which cannot be ignored for future adaptation responses in estuary regions.",0,0,"biased"

Methods and Results This study evaluated the effectiveness of PAW, produced by a plasma bubble reactor, in reducing corrosion causing Pseudomonas aeruginosa planktonic cells in tap water and biofilms were grown onto stainless steel (SS) coupons. Planktonic cells and biofilms were treated with PAW at different discharge frequencies (500-1500 Hz) and exposure times (0-20 min). P. aeruginosa cells in tap water were significantly reduced after treatment, with higher exposure times and discharge frequencies achieving higher reductions. Also, PAW treatment led to a gradual reduction for young and mature biofilms, achieving >4-Log reductions after 20 min. Results were also used to develop two predictive inactivation models. Conclusions This work presents evidence that PAW can be used to inactivate both planktonic cells and biofilms of P. aeruginosa.

Many inhaled materials induce toxic responses in the olfactory (posterior) region of the rat nasal passages. The location of major airflow routes has been proposed as playing a dominant role in determining some olfactory lesion location patterns. Since nasal airflow patterns differ significantly among species, methods are needed to assess conditions under which these differences may significantly affect extrapolation of the effects of local dose in animals to potential disease outcome in humans, A computational fluid dynamics model of airflow and inhaled gas uptake has been used to predict dose to airway walls in the anterior F344 rat nasal passages (Kimbell et al., Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol., 1993; 121, 253-263), To determine the role of nasal airflow patterns in affecting olfactory lesion distribution, this model was extended to include the olfactory region. Serial-step histological sections of the nasal passages of a F344 rat were used to construct the computer model. Simulations of inspiratory airflow throughout the rat nasal passages were consistent with previously reported experimental data, Four of the five major simulated flow streams present in the anterior nose (dorsal lateral, middle, ventral lateral, and ventral medial streams) flowed together to exit ventrally at the nasopharyngeal duct, bypassing the ethmoid recesses. The remaining dorsal medial stream split to flow both medially and laterally through the olfactory-epithelium-lined ethmoid recesses in a Z-shaped pattern when viewed sagitally. Simulated flow in the ethmoid recesses was more than an order of magnitude slower than flow in the anterior and ventral parts of the nasal passages. Somewhat higher volumes of flow were predicted in the dorsal medial stream when the nasal vestibule was reshaped to be upturned, and more flow was allocated to the dorsal medial stream with increased inspiratory airflow rate, suggesting that rats may be able to allocate more airflow to this stream by both modifying the shape of the nasal vestibule and increasing inhaled air velocity during sniffing, The present study provides the first description of flow in the complex olfactory region of the nose of the F344 rat, This model will be used to evaluate the role of airflow patterns in determining the distribution of xenobiotically induced olfactory mucosal lesions. This information, combined with models of disposition in the airway lining, will provide comprehensive dosimetry models for extrapolating animal response data to humans.

Incorporation of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFA), eicosapentaenoic acid, and docosahexaenoic acid into membrane phospholipids provides anti-inflammatory, proresolving, and analgesic effects. This systematic review aims to examine both the quality of studies and the evidence for LC n-3 PUFA in the attenuation of DOMS and inflammation following eccentric exercise, both which of course are empirically linked. The Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science electronic databases were searched to identify studies that supplemented fish oil for a duration of >= 7 days, which included DOMS outcomes following an eccentric exercise protocol. Fifteen (n = 15) studies met inclusion criteria. Eccentric exercise protocols varied from single to multijoint activities. Risk of bias, assessed using either the Cochrane Collaboration tool or the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool, was judged as unclear or medium, respectively, for the majority of outcomes. Furthermore, a custom 5-point quality assessment scale demonstrated that only one (n = 1) study satisfied current recommendations for investigating LC n-3 PUFA. In combination, this highlights widespread inappropriate design protocols among studies investigating the role of LC n-3 PUFA in eccentric exercise.

Cold storage is a frequently used method to preserve them. However, products preserved by traditional frozen method are prone to suffer damage. This can significantly impair the quality of the products. To solve the problem, this work established a novel superchilling storage-ice glazing (SS-IG) approach using chitosan-catechin composite material. It can maximize the postmortem quality of preserved products during storage, avoiding damage. ResultsDuring storage at -1.5 0.2 degrees C for 25 days, the SS-IG approach using 5 g L-1 chitosan and 1 approximate to 3 g L-1 catechin as IG layers can effectively enhance the postmortem quality of preserved tilapia fillets. The sensory qualities of these fillets were effectively maintained. The microbial counts in these fillets were strongly suppressed. Oxidative rancidity in these fillets was observably inhibited.

It has been revealed that Zhongdian island arc zone is an important area with supersized or large Cu-polymetallic deposits. In this regard, we proposed a hybrid method to identify multi-element geochemical anomaly for Cu-polymetallic deposits based on staged factor analysis, improved fractal density and expected value function. In this study, two factors including Cu-Zn and Mo-Pb associations were recognized after four stages of factor analysis of stream sediment geochemical data from Zhongdian area, Yunnan, China. Then, an improved fractal density model was developed to reveal the geochemical distribution patterns of these factors by introducing the parameter P-c (a form of singularity index) based on general fractal topography. The results demonstrate that the proposed model enhanced the anomaly-background structure of Cu geochemical distribution pattern, and effectively characterized the anisotropic scale-invariance of local singularities. Furthermore, the assessment of Cu anomaly uncertainty showed there were about 33% of the Cu occurrences in the low probability areas, indicating these areas based on the Cu anomaly remain uncertain for Cu-polymetallic deposits. Thus, to generate a stronger anomalous signature for Cu-polymetallic potential mapping, the expected value function was utilized for the integration of the two different geochemical signatures, and the fuzzy algebraic sum operator was used also for comparison purpose.

For instance, runoff from intensively cultivated areas leads to higher nutrient and sediment concentrations deteriorating water quality, which potentially trigger trophic state changes. Unfortunately, we have a poor understanding of the complex relationships linking water quality degradation and different ecosystem components. Here we analyze the long-term cascading effects of several anthropogenic stressors on both submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and the key traits of an exploited yellow perch (Perca flavescens, YP) population from the watershed of Lake Saint-Pierre - the largest fluvial lake of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada). Lake Saint-Pierre drains one of the most impacted watersheds in Eastern Canada and had sustained a YP fishery (worth up to 10 M$ CAN/year) until the population collapsed in the mid-1990s. SAV abundance has declined since the 1980s, partially overlapping with the YP collapse. Within a structural equation modeling framework, we tested the links between changes in both SAV abundance and the YP fishery with abiotic stressors acting at both local and larger scales. Our results show that both SAV and YP declines are causally associated with anthropogenic nutrient and sediment loadings from the watershed. The decline of YP landings is also explained by a reduction in SAV abundance and YP juvenile growth, mainly caused by a sharp decrease in water transparency over the last decades. These results suggest a causal association between environmental degradation due to nutrients and sediments and different components of the trophic aquatic network. Such an integrative approach is crucial for the development of management strategies that consider cultivated lands and aquatic systems as a continuum rather than separate compartments. SAV restoration is thus a critical feature contributing to water depuration and promoting the recovery of fish populations threatened by habitat degradation. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

For each climate scenario, three sets of numerical experiments were performed: (1) a CTRL experiment in which all crops are assumed to be rainfed; (2) an IRRIG experiment in which the irrigation module is activated using surface water (SW) to feed irrigation; and (3) a PUMP experiment in which a groundwater pumping scheme coupled with the irrigation module is activated for conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater (GW) for irrigation. The parameters associated with irrigation and groundwater pumping are calibrated based on a global inventory of census-based water use compiled by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). Our results suggest that irrigation could lead to two major effects: SW (GW) depletion in regions with irrigation primarily fed by SW (GW), respectively. Furthermore, irrigation depending primarily on SW tends to have larger impacts on low-flow than high-flow conditions, suggesting increased vulnerability to drought. By the end of the 21st century, combined effect of increased irrigation water demand and amplified temporal-spatial variability of water supply may lead to severe local water scarcity for irrigation. Regionally, irrigation has the potential to aggravate/alleviate climate-induced changes of SW/GW although such effects are negligible when averaged globally.

Crabs collected from a second, more arid, geographical location in northern Australia had a similar AET using 3 degrees C h(-1) increase (AET(50) = 35.3; maximum 37.60 degrees C) and a similar AET using 18 degrees C h(-1) increase (AET(50) = 39.3; maximum 41.7 degrees C) to the coastal crab results (ANCOVA interaction location and ramp rate F = 1.88, P > 0.15). A temperature rate altering AET estimates by several degrees (regardless of where crab population was collected: ANCOVA location, F = 0.668, P > 0.4; rate increase factor, F = 4.31, P < 0.001) highlights the need for laboratory experiments to be underpinned by relevant field data. These data outline that crab avoidance responses could include accessing river banks, as a response necessary to regulate temperature during critical periods.",0,0,"biased"
