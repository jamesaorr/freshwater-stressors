Data and code used for the paper: *"Studying interactions among anthropogenic stressors in freshwater ecosystems: a systematic review of 2,396 multiple-stressor experiments"* by James A. Orr, Samuel J. Macaulay, Adriana Mordente, Benjamin Burgess, Dania Albini, Julia G. Hunn, Katherin Restrepo-Sulez, Ramesh Wilson, Anne Schechner, Aoife M. Robertson, Bethany Lee, Blake Stuparyk, Delezia Singh, Isobel O’Loughlin, Jeremy J. Piggott, Jiangqiu Zhu, Khuong V. Dinh, Louise C. Archer, Marcin Penk, Minh Thi Thuy Vu, Noël P.D. Juvigny-Kkenafou, Peiyu Zhang, Philip Sanders, Ralf B. Schäfer, Rolf Vinebrooke, Sabine Hilt, Thomas Reed, Michelle C. Jackson

The ***"1. dataset"*** folder contains "freshwater_multistressor_experiments.csv", which is the dataset produced by our systematic review and "freshwater_multistressor_experiments_metadata.csv", which contains descriptions of each of the variables in the dataset. 

The ***"2. figures"*** folder contains an R notebook (R 4.3.1) with the code used to reproduce the figures in the main paper and in the supporting information. A list of all the packages and the versions that were used can be found in Supporting Table 3 (in the supporting information of the main publication).  

The ***"3. shiny app"*** folder contains the R code (R 4.3.1) used to create the interactive version of the dataset. This interactive web application can be found running at: https://jamesaorr.shinyapps.io/freshwater-multiple-stressors/

The ***"4. abstract screening"*** folder contains the results of the abstract screening process, which was performed using a novel machine learning tool called ASReview. It also contains a folder called "simulation results" containing the data and code used for the simulation study testing the importance of the training data (described in section 3.6 of the supporting information).
